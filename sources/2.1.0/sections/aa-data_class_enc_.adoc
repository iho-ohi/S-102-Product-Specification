=== Feature Attributes

==== BathymetryCoverage

.BathymetryCoverage feature attribute parameters
[cols="a"]
|===

|IHO Definition: *depth*. The vertical distance from a given water level to the bottom [<<iho-s32>>].

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* Drying heights (drying depths) are indicated by a negative value.

|IHO Definition: *uncertainty*. The interval (about a given value) that will contain the true value of the measurement at a specific confidence level [<<iho-s44>>].

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* Represents a +/- value defining the possible range of associated depth.
* Expressed a positive number.
