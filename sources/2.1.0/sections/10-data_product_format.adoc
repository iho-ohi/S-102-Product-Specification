== Data Product Format (Encoding)

=== Introduction
The S-102 data set must be encoded using the Hierarchical Data Format standard, Version 5 (HDF5).

*Format Name*:: HDF5

*Version*:: 1.8

*Character Set*:: UTF-8

*Specification*:: https://www.hdfgroup.org/

The key idea behind the S-102 product structure is that each coverage is a feature. Each of these features is co-located with the others. Therefore, they share the same spatial metadata and each is required to correctly interpret the others.

For the use of HDF5, the following key concepts (<<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=10c-5.1>>) are important:

_File_:: a contiguous string of bytes in a computer store (memory, disk, etc.), and the bytes represent zero or more objects of the model;

_Group_:: a collection of objects (including groups);

_Dataset_:: a multidimensional array of data elements with attributes and other metadata;

_Dataspace_:: a description of the dimensions of a multidimensional array;

_Datatype_:: a description of a specific class of data element including its storage layout as a pattern of bits;

_Attribute_:: a named data value associated with a group, dataset, or named datatype;

_Property List_:: a collection of parameters (some permanent and some transient).

In addition, datasets may be a compound (a single record consisting of an array of simple value types) and have multiple dimensions.

=== Product structure
The structure of the data product follows the form given in <<iho-s100,part=10C>> -- HDF5 Data Model and File Format. The general structure, which was designed for several S-100 products is given in <<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>>.

[[fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure]]
.Outline of the generic data file structure
image::figure-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure.png[]

<<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>> shows the four levels defined within the HDF encoding as defined in <<iho-s100,part=10c>>. Below is a further definition of these levels.

*Level 1*:: At the top level lies the Root Group, and it contains the Root Metadata and two subsidiary groups. The Root Metadata applies to all S-100 type products.

*Level 2*:: The next Level contains the Feature Information Group and the Feature Container Group. The Feature Information Group contains the feature *BathymetryCoverage* and the feature attribute codes. The Feature Container Group contains the Feature Metadata and one or more Feature Instance Groups.

*Level 3*:: This contains a Feature Instance group. A feature instance is a bathymetric gridded data for a single region.

*Level 4*:: This contains the actual data for each feature. In S-102 the BathymetryCoverage uses the ValuesGroup to define the content the other groups at this level are not used.

In <<tab-overview-of-s102-data-product>> below, levels refer to HDF5 structuring (see <<iho-s100,part=10c,figure=10c-9>>). Naming in each box below the header line is as follows: Generic name; S-100 or S-102 name, or [] if none; and (_HDF5 type_) group, attribute or attribute list, or dataset.

[[note1]]
[NOTE]
====
The value horizontalDatumValue specifies the horizontal Coordinate Reference System. At the time of writing, S-100 does not yet provide a mechanism for this value's definition within HDF5 encoding. Consequently, this configuration causes a deviation from S-100. The horizontal datum is implicitly defined by this CRS because each horizontal CRS consists of a coordinate system and a datum.
====

[[note2]]
[NOTE]
====
The baseCRS is the geodetic CRS on which the projected CRS is based. In particular, the datum of the base CRS is also used for the derived CRS (see <<iho-s100,table=6-6>>).
====

The following sections explain entries in <<tab-overview-of-s102-data-product>> in greater detail.

==== Feature Codes (Group_F)
No attributes.

This group specifies the S-100 features to which the data applies, and consists of two components:

*featureCode* -- a dataset with the featureCode(s) of the S-100 feature(s) contained in the data product. For S-102, the dataset has only *BathymetryCoverage*. 

*BathymetryCoverage* -- Described in the featureCode table. This feature contains the standard definition of the feature class. 

==== BathymetryCoverage Table (in Group_F)

BathymetryCoverage is an array of compound type elements, whose components are the 8 components specified in <<tab-sample-contents-of-the-two-dimensional-bathymetrycoverage-array>>.

As per section <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=10c-9.5>>, "All the numeric values in the feature description dataset are string representations of numeric values; for example, "-9999.0" not the float value -9999.0."

While the sample contents are shown in the two attributes columns, these are actually rows in the BathymetryCoverage table. They are also each a single HDF5 compound type and represent a single HDF5 element in the table.

All cells shall be HDF5 variable length strings. The minimum and maximum values are stored in lower and upper columns. Variable length strings allow future proofing the format in the event editing is allowed or correcting these values is required.

|===

The gridOriginLongitude, gridOriginLatitude, gridSpacingLongitudinal and gridSpacingLatitudinal attributes should be in the same geographic units as the bounding box. Note that this deviates from S100 where it indicates that this should be in Arc Degrees. This has the effect that gridOriginLongitude and gridOriginLatitude are identical to westBoundLongitude and southBoundLatitude.

The gridOriginLongitude and gridOriginLatitude are the cell center of the cell.

numPointsLongitude and numPointsLatitude must contain the number of cells in the x and y dimensions of the values table.

==== The values group - Group_001
This group contains the following attributes. These attributes are not defined by <<iho-s100,part=10c>>. They are an extension of this Product Specification.

The group contains an HDF5 dataset named values containing the bathymetric gridded data.

==== The Dataset - values

This dataset contains the compound data arrays containing bathymetric gridded data. These components are explained below.

For bathymetric gridded data, the dataset includes a two-dimensional array containing both the depth and uncertainty data. These dimensions are defined by _numPointsLongitudinal_ and _numPointsLatitudinal_. By knowing the grid origin and the grid spacing, the position of every point in the grid can be simply computed. If uncertainty data is not used, it must be filled with the fillValue specified in the Group_F feature information dataset.

The depth and uncertainty values (depth and uncertainty) are stored in two-dimensional arrays with a prescribed number of columns (numCOL) and rows (numROW). This grid is defined as a regular grid (dataCodingFormat = 2); therefore, the depth and uncertainty values will be for each discrete point in the grid. The data type of the array values is a compound with two members.

==== Mandatory Naming Conventions
The following group and attribute names are mandatory in S-100: Group_F, featureCode, and (for S-102) *BathymetryCoverage*, axisNames, *BathymetryCoverage01*, and Group_nnn.
