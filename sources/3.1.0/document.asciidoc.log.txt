[[sec-overview]]
== Overview
With the advent of electronic navigation and the technological progress of surveying systems and production capabilities, the ability to enhance maritime navigation with the portrayal of high-resolution bathymetry has become a requirement. The provision and utilization of such data in a standardized format is essential to support the safe and precise navigation of marine vessels, and furthermore an important basis for many other maritime applications.

=== Scope
This document describes an S-100 compliant product specification for a bathymetric surface product. Incorporating aspects of the navigation surface concept <<NavigationSurface,[Smith et al, 2002]>>, an {series}-{docnumber} bathymetric surface product is a digital elevation model which represents the seafloor in a regular grid structure. It can be used alone or as an important element/source for future S-100 conformant ECDIS navigation. The product specification is based on the IHO S-100 framework specification and the ISO 19100 series of standards. It comprises the content model (spatial structure and metadata), encoding structure, portrayal and exchange file format for a bathymetric surface product.

==== Use of language

Within this document:

* "`Must`" indicates a mandatory requirement.
* "`Should`" indicates an optional requirement, that is the recommended process to be followed, but is not mandatory.
* "`May`" means "`allowed to`" or "`could possibly`" and is not mandatory.


==== Terms and definitions

===== Accuracy

Closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference values.

NOTE: A test result can be from an observation or measurement.

===== Coordinate

One of a sequence of _n_ numbers designating the position of a point in N-dimensional space.

NOTE: The numbers must be qualified by units and CRS.

===== Coordinate Reference System

*Coordinate* system which is related to the real world by a datum.

===== Coverage

*Feature* that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal, or *spatiotemporal domain*.

NOTE: In other words, a coverage is a feature that has multiple values for each attribute type, where each direct position within the geometric representation of the feature has a single value for each attribute type.

[example]
Examples include a digital image, polygon overlay, or digital elevation matrix

===== Coverage Geometry

Configuration of the *domain* of a *coverage* described in terms of *coordinates*.

===== Direct Position

Position described by a single set of *coordinates* within a *coordinate reference system*.

===== Domain

Well-defined set.

NOTE: Domains are used to define the domain set and range set of attributes, operators, and functions.

===== Depth

The vertical distance from a given water level to the bottom. In this standard, depth refers to the S-32 definition of "Depth Charted".

NOTE: The numbers must be qualified by units and datum.

===== Feature

Abstraction of real-world phenomena.

NOTE: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant.

===== Feature Attribute

Characteristic of a *feature*.

NOTE: A feature attribute type has a name, a data type, and a domain associated to it. A feature attribute instance has an attribute value taken from the value domain of the feature attribute type.

===== Function

Rule that associates each element from a *domain* (source, or domain of the function) to a unique element in another domain (target, co-domain, or *range*).

NOTE: The range is defined by another domain.

===== Geometric Object

Spatial object representing a set of *direct positions*.

NOTE: A geometric object consists of a geometric primitive, a collection of geometric primitives, or a geometric complex treated as a single entity. A geometric object may be the spatial characteristics of an object such as a feature or a significant part of a feature.

===== Grid

Network composed of two or more sets of curves in which the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets in a systematic way.

NOTE: The curves partition a space into grid cells.

===== Grid Point

Point located at the intersection of two or more curves in a *grid*.

===== Lidar

An optical remote sensing technique that uses a laser pulse to determine distance.

NOTE: Lidar may be used to determine depth in shallow water areas.

===== Navigation Surface

A *coverage* representing the bathymetry and associated uncertainty with the methods by which those objects can be manipulated, combined, and used for a number of tasks, certified for safety of navigation.

===== Range <coverage>

Set of values associated by a *function* with the elements of the *spatiotemporal domain* of a *coverage*.

===== Record

Finite, named collection of related items (objects or values).

NOTE: Logically, a record is a set of pairs <name, item >.

===== Rectified Grid

*Grid* for which there is a linear relationship between the *grid coordinates* and the *coordinates* of an external *coordinate reference system*.

NOTE: If the coordinate reference system is related to the earth by a datum, the grid is a georectified grid.

===== Referenceable Grid

*Grid* associated with a transformation that can be used to convert *grid coordinate* values to values of coordinates referenced to an *external coordinate reference system*.

===== Sonar

A technique that uses sound propagation through water to determine distance, primarily *depth* measurement.

===== Spatiotemporal Domain <coverage>

*Domain* composed of *geometric objects* described in terms of spatial and/or temporal *coordinates*.

NOTE: The spatiotemporal domain of a continuous coverage consists of a set of direct positions defined in relation to a collection of geometric objects.

===== Surface

Connected 2-dimensional geometric primitive, representing the continuous image of a region of a plane.

NOTE: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that delineate the limits of the surface.

===== Uncertainty

The interval (about a given value) that will contain the true value of the measurement at a specific confidence level.

NOTE: Errors exist and are the differences between the measured value and the true value. Since the true value is never known it follows that the error itself cannot be known. Uncertainty is a statistical assessment of the likely magnitude of this error. The numbers must be qualified by units.

[[itd]]In this document an {series}-{docnumber} uncertainty is always considered to be 1-dimensional and at the 2-sigma or 95% confidence level.[[conlev]]

===== Vector

Quantity having direction as well as magnitude.

NOTE: A directed line segment represents a vector if the length and direction of the line segment are equal to the magnitude and direction of the vector. The term vector data refers to data that represents the spatial configuration of features as a set of directed line segments.

=== IHO Product Specification Maintenance

==== Introduction
Changes to {series}-{docnumber} will be released by the IHO as a New Edition, revision, or clarification.

==== New Edition
_New Editions_ of {series}-{docnumber} introduce significant changes. _New Editions_ enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types. _New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing users or future users of {series}-{docnumber}. All cumulative _revisions_ and _clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved New Editions.

==== Revision
_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to {series}-{docnumber}. Typically, _revisions_ will change {series}-{docnumber} to correct factual errors; introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result of practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must not be classified as a clarification. Revisions could have an impact on either existing users or future users of {series}-{docnumber}. All cumulative _clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved _revisions_.

Changes in a revision are minor and ensure backward compatibility with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions, for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues.

In most cases a new feature or portrayal catalogue will result in a _revision_ of {series}-{docnumber}.

==== Clarification
_Clarifications_ are non-substantive changes to {series}-{docnumber}. Typically, _clarifications_: remove ambiguity; correct grammatical and spelling errors; amend or update cross references; insert improved graphics in spelling, punctuation and grammar. A _clarification_ must not cause any substantive semantic change to {series}-{docnumber}.

Changes in a _clarification_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility with the previous versions within the same Edition. Within the same Edition, a dataset of one clarification version could always be processed with a later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues, and a Portrayal Catalogue can always rely on earlier versions of the Feature Catalogue.


==== Version Numbers
The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to {series}-{docnumber} must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as **n**.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.**n**.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.**n**

== Data Content and Structure

=== Introduction
The Bathymetric Surface Product incorporates aspects of the Navigation Surface concept where in addition to estimation of depth, an optional estimate of the uncertainty associated with the depth can be computed and preserved. <<fig-overview-structure-s102>> below shows a high-level overview of the structure of S-102. It shows that the Bathymetric Surface Product consists of a set of data comprising the HDF5 datasets plus a Digital Certification Block. The Digital Certification Block is mandatory so that the user can trace whether the data has been certified. The HDF5 file consists of metadata (spatial, feature and discovery) and collocated coverages consisting of depth values, uncertainty values, and references to metadata records. S-102 uses the S-100 Data Protection Scheme to ensure certification and authentication.

[[fig-overview-structure-s102]]
.Overview Structure of S-102
image::../images/figure-overview-structure-s102.png["Within a larger block: Version Tag, Metadata Block, Bathymetry Coverage, and Quality of Bathymetry Coverage blocks. As a separate block: Digital Certification Block.",450,525]

Thus, the Bathymetric Surface Product is a hybrid of coverages, as defined in <<iho-s100,part=8>>, and metadata packages as defined in <<iho-s100,part=4>>. This is described in <<subsec-application-schema>>.

[[subsec-application-schema]]
=== Application Schema
The Application Schema Data Set Structure is shown in <<fig-data-set-structure-s102>> and <<fig-coverage-structure-of-s102>>. They show a number of classes specialized for use in S-102 and six sets of implementation classes. An actual data set of S-102 bathymetry data contains only the implementation classes. All of the required attributes from the other classes in the application schema are satisfied by statements within the Product Specification. This approach to producing the Application Schema results in a very simple structure for implementation.

[[fig-data-set-structure-s102]]
.Data Set Structure of S-102
image::../images/figure-data-set-structure-s102.png[UML diagram depicting the Application Schema Data Set Structure as described between this figure and the Coverage Structure figure]


The model in <<fig-data-set-structure-s102>> states that:

* An S-102 data set (*S102_DataSet*), which is inherited from *S100_DataSet*, references an S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection (*S102_IGCollection*). In S-100 it is possible to have multiple collections but in S-102 only one is needed to hold the bathymetry coverage. The S-102 discovery metadata class (*S102_DiscoveryMetadata*) describes the metadata entities required for the identification of the entire data set. The required discovery metadata is implemented through the *S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata* class defined in <<iho-s100,part=17>>.

* An instance of an S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection (*S102_IGCollection*) which is a subtype of *S100_IGCollection*, is described by a set of S-102 Collection Metadata (*S102_CollectionMetadata*). This relationship is 1 to 1 meaning that there is one set of collection metadata for each instance of *S102_IGCollection*. There is a large choice of metadata that may be used in an S-100 compliant data product. Only a small amount of this metadata is mandated by <<iso-19115-1>> for discovery. This edition of S-102 neither uses ISO metadata files nor extends S-100 generic metadata and therefore *S102_CollectionMetadata*, *S102_StructuralMetadata*, *S102_QualityMetadata*, and *S102_AcquisitionMetadata* are abstract classes as described in <<iho-s100,part=8,clause=8.5.3>>. This edition of S-102 uses the dataset metadata elements defined in <<iho-s100,part=17>> and <<iho-s100,part=10c>> with restrictions defined in this product specification. The metadata elements defined in <<iho-s100,part=17>> are encoded in a discovery block within the exchange catalogue (<<iho-s100,part=17,clause=17.4.4>> to <<iho-s100,part=17,clause=17.4.5>>), and the metadata elements defined in <<iho-s100,part=10c>> are encoded as attributes and datasets within the HDF5 file (<<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=10c.9.2>>). The conceptual structure of coverage features in an S-102 dataset is discussed further in <<subsec-application-schema-implementation-classes>>.

[[fig-coverage-structure-of-s102]]
.Coverage Structure of S-102
image::../images/figure-coverage-structure-of-s102.png[UML diagram depicting the Application Schema Coverage Structure as described between this figure and Application Schema implementation classes]

The model in <<fig-coverage-structure-of-s102>> depicts the coverage type in this application schema:

* The coverage type for *BathymetryCoverage* is a continuous Regular Grid Coverage called *S102_DepthCoverage* which inherits from *S100_IF_GridCoverage*. Many of the parameters of the coverage are described in the Product Specification.

* The coverage type for *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* is a continuous Regular Grid Coverage called *S102_QualityCoverage* which inherits from *S100_IF_GridCoverage*. Many of the parameters of the coverage are described in the Product Specification.

[[subsec-application-schema-implementation-classes]]
==== Application Schema implementation classes
The implementation classes for the template application schema are shown in <<fig-implementation-of-classes>>. The attributes are shown for the coverage related classes together with the attribute classes.

In order to simplify the implementation, a number of defaults are assumed for S-102. These defaults simplify implementation and help simplify interaction with the Navigation Surface implementation from the Open Navigation Surface Working Group and other bathymetric gridded types. In the following sub clauses, the default values are emphasized so that they do not need to be encoded when generating an encoding of the implementation classes. However, if specified they must assume the stated values unless other options are stated.

===== Implementation classes description

[level=6]
===== BathymetryCoverage

[level=7]
===== BathymetryCoverage semantics

The class *BathymetryCoverage* has the attributes _minimumDepth_, _maximumDepth_, _minimumUncertainty_, and _maximumUncertainty_ which bound the depth attribute and the uncertainty attribute from the *S102_BathymetryValues* record. *BathymetryCoverage* additionally contains the inherited attributes _origin_, _offsetVectors_, _dimension_, _axisName_, _extent_, _sequenceRule_, and _startSequence_ from *S100_IF_Grid* and *CV_Grid*.

The origin is a position in a specified coordinate reference system, and a set of offset vectors specify the direction and distance between the grid lines. It also contains the additional geometric characteristics of a rectified grid.

=== Feature Catalogue

==== Introduction
The S-102 Feature Catalogue describes the feature types, attributes and attribute values which may be used in the product.

[[tsf]]The S-102 Feature Catalogue is available in an XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML Feature Catalogue Schema and can be downloaded from the IHO Geospatial Information Registry.[[ihoweb]]

==== Feature types
S-102 is a coverage feature product. *BathymetryCoverage* implements *S102_DepthCoverage* and includes *S102_BathymetryValues*. *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* implements *S102_QualityCoverage* and includes *S102_QualityValues*.

===== Geographic
Geographic (geo) feature types form the principle content of the dataset and are fully defined by their associated attributes. In S-102, *BathymetryCoverage* has been registered as a geographic feature type.

===== Meta
Meta feature types are allowed in the dataset and are fully defined by their associated attributes. In S-102, *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* has been registered as a meta feature type.

==== Feature relationship
S-102 does not use any feature relationships.

==== Attributes

===== Simple attributes

In S-102, _depth_ and _uncertainty_ have been registered as simple attributes, type `<real>`; and _iD_ has been registered as a simple attribute, type `<integer>`. Simple attributes are defined in <<iho-s100,part=5,clause=5-4.2.3.3>>.

===== Complex attributes
In S-102 there are currently no complex attributes defined.

=== Dataset types

==== Introduction
Bathymetric Surface datasets are represented as regular grids. The general structure for a regular grid is defined in <<iho-s100,part=8>>. Each sample in a grid represents the value in the grid cell area.

The georeferencing for an S-102 Bathymetric Surface product shall be grid point based, referenced from the southwesternmost grid point. The reference position (grid origin) included in the metadata, precisely the attributes _gridOriginLatitude_ and _gridOriginLongitude_, shall be given in the coordinates used for the grid and shall contain sufficient digits of precision to locate the grid with accuracy no worse than a decimetre on the surface of the ellipsoid of rotation of the chosen horizontal datum.

[[fig-s102-cell-area-and-Bbox]]

image::../images/figure-s102-cell-area-and-Bbox.png["S-102 grid components"]

==== Regular grid

===== S-102 coverages
The *BathymetryCoverage* contains _depth_ and, optionally, _uncertainty_. The general structure of each is defined in <<iho-s100,part=8>> as a georectified grid. Similarly, the *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* contains _id_.

The grid properties of origin and spacing are defined by attributes in the *BathymetryCoverage.nn* and *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage.01* Feature Instance Groups. Each grid is a two-dimensional matrix organized in row major order and starting from the southwesternmost grid point. Thus, for each grid, the first sample is the point at the southwest corner of the grid with location specified by the georeferencing parameters, the second is one grid resolution unit to the east of that position and at the same northing or latitude, and the third is two grid resolution units to the east and at the same northing or latitude. For stem:[C] columns in the grid, the stem:[(C+1)]^th^ sample in the grid is located one grid resolution unit to the north but on the same easting or longitude as the first sample in the grid.

[[fig-s102-grid-point-location]]
.S-102 Grid point location

For *BathymetryCoverage.nn*, _depth_ and optional _uncertainty_, are stored in the same grid as members of a data compound. The units of the depth values are in metres. The vertical distance is from a given water level to the bottom. Drying heights (drying soundings) are indicated by a negative depth value. For *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage.01*, only _id_ is stored in the grid.

The unknown state for depth is defined to be 1,000,000.0 (1.0e6).

The uncertainty values are expressed as positive quantities at each grid cell. As detailed in <<tab-elements-of-featureAttributeTable-compound-datatype>> and <<tab-codes-defining-how-bathy-depth-uncertainty-determined>> the uncertainty grid supports multiple definitions of vertical uncertainty. A recipient of an S-102 file can refer to the uncertainty definition in the Metadata to gain an understanding of how the uncertainty was computed.

The undetermined state for uncertainty is defined to be 1,000,000.0 (1.0e6).

The _id_ values in *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage.01* are expressed as unsigned 32-bit integer at each grid cell. Each value corresponds to the identifier for a metadata record in a *featureAttributeTable* <<root-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage>>.

The fill value for _id_ is defined to be 0.

===== Extensions
In S-102 there are currently no extensions defined.

=== Multiple datasets
In order to facilitate the efficient processing of S-102 data, the geographic coverage of a given *maximum display Scale* may be split into multiple datasets.

=== Dataset rules
Each S-102 dataset must only have a single extent as it is a coverage feature.

There should be no overlapping data of the same maximum display scale, except at the agreed adjoining limits. Where it is difficult to achieve a perfect join, a buffer to be agreed upon by the producing agencies may be used.

=== Geometry
S-102 regular gridded coverages are an implementation of S100_IF_GridCoverage <<iho-s100,part=8,clause=8.7>>.

== Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

=== Introduction

The Coordinate Reference System information contained in <<tab-s102-coordinate-reference-systems-epsg-codes>> is defined in the manner specified in <<iho-s100,part=6>>. The vertical datum is specified separately using other root group attributes.

=== Vertical Coordinate Reference System
Although in this product there are no direct vertical coordinates the values of the depth attributes are indirectly such coordinates. Therefore, it is important to specify the vertical CRS to which these values conform. The vertical CRS is an earth gravity-based, one-axis coordinate system. The Orientation of the axis is defined by the vertical coordinate system attribute (_verticalCS_) in the root group (see <<tab-root-group-attributes>>).

The vertical datum must be taken from the code-list specified by the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry for the attribute named _Vertical Datum_. It will be defined in the root group as an HDF5 attribute (see <<tab-root-group-attributes>>).


=== Temporal reference system
The temporal reference system is the Gregorian calendar for date and UTC for time. Time is measured by reference to Calendar dates and Clock time in accordance with <<iso-8601,clause=5.4.4>>. A date-time variable will have the following 16-character format: _yyyymmddThhmmssZ_.


[[sec-data-quality]]
== Data Quality
Data quality allows users and user systems to assess fitness for use of the provided data. Data quality measures and the associated evaluation are reported as metadata of a data product. This metadata improves interoperability with other data products and provides usage by user groups that the data product was not originally intended for. The secondary users can make assessments of the data product usefulness in their application based on the reported data quality measures.

If the dataset conforms to <<sec-data-product-format-encoding>>, the dataset PASSES this test.



=== Positional accuracy

==== Gridded data positional accuracy
Gridded positional accuracy is defined by the precision of the positional reference used to specify its location within its spatial projection. These positional references are contained within the spatial metadata of the S-102 grid. It is assumed that any horizontal errors are assimilated into the vertical uncertainty. The vertical values are calculated for each grid point using the processes and procedures used by each hydrographic office during the creation of the S-102 grid. Appropriate selection of both the origin reference point and spatial resolution are important and are another factor in gridded positional accuracy.

==== Relative internal positional accuracy
The internal positional accuracy is defined as the precision of the location of each grid point within the S-102 grid. The position of each grid point within the grid is referenced by a row and column combination. The metadata for S-102 defines a gridded resolution along both the X and Y axis of the grid. This absolute position of a grid point within the spatial projection of the grid is calculated using the row/column and the X/Y resolution. In this case, the accuracy is controlled by the precision used in defining these resolutions.

=== Temporal accuracy

Temporal accuracy, consistency, and validity of bathymetric grids are confined to elements of the vertical control processes. These aspects are addressed during the formulation and application of vertical control processes applied by the various hydrographic offices. Details of these processes will be included in the Lineage portion of the metadata defined in <<sec-metadata>> of this Product Specification.

=== Thematic accuracy

==== Thematic classification correctness
For S-102 bathymetric grids there are two classifications of data values, which are land and water. There are two considerations for assessing classification correctness when using the grid. The first is that values given in the depth layer of the S-102 grid are based on the associated hydrographic office's chosen vertical datum. Should another value in relation to a different vertical datum be required, a series of correctors would need to be applied. Secondly, when considering the data values, the value stored in the uncertainty for a given grid point must be considered. This uncertainty value represents the magnitude of possible deviation in either direction from the data value and must be applied when assessing the classification correctness. The new value generated when applied may cause a change in the classification.

==== Non-quantitative attribute accuracy
Thematic accuracy of S-102 bathymetric data is wholly quantitative.


==== Quantitative attribute accuracy
As defined in <<iho-s100,part=4c>> the data quality for the depth coverage is also defined as a co-located optional coverage, which is the uncertainty. This value particularly refers to the vertical uncertainty at each grid point. The uncertainty coverage supports multiple definitions of vertical uncertainty.

See <<tab-codes-defining-how-bathy-depth-uncertainty-determined>>.



== Data Capture and Classification
The DCEG describes how data describing the real world should be captured using the types defined in the S-102 Feature Catalogue. The DCEG is located at <<annex-data-classification-and-encoding-guide>>.

A number of sounding techniques are used to capture bathymetric data. It is permitted, but not required, to include data acquisition information in the metadata of an S-102 Bathymetric Surface product. The metadata class S102_AcquisitionMetadata has been defined, but the information elements to populate this metadata class should be identified in a national profile of S-102.

[[qualityAndSourceMetadata]]
=== Quality and source metadata

Quality and source metadata in S-102 are intended to enable and support future navigation software to appropriately auto-generate and attribute cartographic features such as custom depth contours and soundings from S-102 products, all while minimally impacting the overall file size of the product.

Quality and source metadata are encoded in a feature attribute table compliant with both HDF5 and S-100. This feature attribute table will provide valuable information about the bathymetry on a grid cellwise basis compared to traditional vector-based metadata files, simplifying the interpretation and implementation by navigation software systems.

The fields of the feature attribute table are defined elsewhere in this Product Specification (<<tab-attributes-of-values-group>>).

Quality and source metadata in S-102 are based on S-101 quality attributes, with significant augmentations and omissions described below. The quality and source metadata support a threefold purpose:

. Support S-101-defined attribution of auto-generated vector depth areas, depth contours, and soundings created directly from the S-102 dataset.

.. The attribute _featureSizeVar_ is meant to augment _featureSize_ which corresponds to S-101 size of features detected. As noted in S-101, size of features detected is intended to be described as the smallest size in cubic metres the survey was capable of detecting. Depending on various survey parameters, this definition might require different depth ranges to have different values. For example, a survey vessel working at a fixed height off the seafloor (such as an autonomous underwater survey vessel) could maintain a fixed feature detection size capability over a wide range of depths. Conversely, a surface vessel working over that same range of depths may have a feature detection capability that varies with depth. The latter situation could foreseeably cause the detection capability to be ambiguous and potentially misrepresented. For this reason, _featureSizeVar_ is defined as the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of minimum detectable feature size to water depth. When both _featureSize_ and _featureSizeVar_ are present, the whichever value implies a larger feature size should be considered valid. The expectation is that _featureSizeVar_ will be set to zero if the feature size does not scale with depth. As with _featureSize_, _featureSizeVar_ should be ignored if _significantFeatures_ is False.

.. Note that depth range maximum and minimum in S-101 are omitted. The assumption is that if this information is required, then the corresponding grid cells in the elevation layer can be queried for a minimum and maximum depth for each table row.

. Provide necessary uncertainty information as an input into critical underkeel clearance precision navigation systems.

. Prevent the automated selection of soundings from interpolated grid cells, while still providing the continuous data required for depth contour creation. This purpose is accomplished by the _bathyCoverage_ Boolean attribute field. This field enables the flagging of grid cells populated by interpolation (when that interpolation occurs across gaps in bathymetric observations greater than the S-102 grid spatial resolution). This functionality is especially useful in side-scan surveys which are characterized by gaps in bathymetric observations with full coverage side-scan imagery. In this case, interpolated gaps between bathymetry coverage would show _fullSeafloorCoverageAchieved_ = True and _bathyCoverage_ = False. However, if _fullSeafloorCoverageAchieved_ = False, _bathyCoverage_ must also equal False (e.g., gaps between single beam echosounder data without correlating side scan sonar coverage). Thus, this facility will provide navigation software systems with the required information necessary to preferably select soundings from direct bathymetric observations.

Quality and source metadata are encoded as records within a featureAttributeTable dataset, which is itself within the QualityOfBathymetryCoverage container group (<<tab-attributes-of-values-group>>).


== Data Maintenance

=== Maintenance and update frequency
Datasets are maintained by replacement on a dataset basis. That is, the entire data product and the associated metadata are replaced as a unit. This is unlike vector data that may be updated incrementally. Also, each replacement data set must have its own digital signature.

=== Data source
Data producers must use applicable sources to maintain and update data and provide a brief description of the sources that were used to produce the dataset.

=== Production process
Data Producers should follow their established production processes for maintaining and updating datasets.


[[sec-portrayal]]
== Portrayal

=== Introduction
S-102 portrayal is intended to contribute to the safe operation of an S-100 based marine navigation system by:

* Ensuring display of bathymetric surfaces, standards of colours, and their assignment to depths;
* Ensuring the display is clear and unambiguous;
* Establishing an accepted pattern for presentation that becomes familiar to mariners and so can be recognized instantly without confusion; and
* Utilizing the S-100 portrayal model to ensure interoperability.

To ensure that presentation remains intuitive, the following principles must be followed when changes are made to the S-102 Portrayal Catalogue:

* S-102 must maintain equivalence in terms of alerts and indications functionality in ECDIS;
* The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue should be modified by extension. Portrayal rules should be retained for items that have been superseded in the current version of S-102. This retention ensures that S-102 data produced to previous versions can be displayed using the latest Portrayal Catalogue.

S-102 portrayal is covered by the portrayal model as defined in S-100. This model reflects how the Portrayal Catalogue is defined for use in marine navigation systems.

S-102 uses the portrayal processes defined in <<iho-s100,part=9>> and <<iho-s100,part=9a>>. Items included in the S-102 Portrayal Catalogue must be registered in the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry.

The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue contains the mechanisms for the system to portray information found in S-102 bathymetric surfaces. The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue contains the following types of mechanisms and structures:

* Set of portrayal rules;
* Set of colour profiles.

The Portrayal Catalogue model is defined in <<iho-s100,part=9,clause=9-13>>. The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue is available in an XML document, which conforms to the S-100 XML Portrayal Catalogue Schema. The structure for the Portrayal Catalogue is described in <<iho-s100,part=9,clause=9-13.2>>.

<<fig-s52-depth-zone-colouring-for-day>> is included to illustrate informative depth zone colouring as adapted from S-52. More comprehensive portrayal details can be found in the S-102 Portrayal Catalogue, which is available in the IHO GI Registry (as detailed in <<tab-s102-portrayal-catalogue-citation-info>>).

==== Use of sun-illumination
S-102 data can be visualized as a sun-illuminated or static (flat) dataset. The depiction of sun-illumination requires the entry of a sun azimuth and corresponding elevation. <<fig-sun-illuminated-and-static-flat-shading>> shows the difference between a sun-illuminated and static (flat) surface.

NOTE: Although sun-illumination provides marked benefit to the user, it is not currently supported by S-100. As such, it is advisable for ECDIS manufacturers to implement the facility of sun-illumination in order to make such a benefit available.


Informative values for sun azimuth angle and elevation have been provided in <<tab-sun-azimuth-and-elevation-values>> below.

[[sec-data-product-format-encoding]]
== Data Product Format (Encoding)

=== Introduction
The S-102 data set must be encoded using the Hierarchical Data Format standard, Version 5 (HDF5).

*Format Name*:: HDF5

*Version*:: 1.8.8

*Character Set*:: UTF-8

*Specification*:: link:++https://www.hdfgroup.org/++[]

The key idea behind the S-102 product structure is that each coverage is a feature. Each of these features is co-located with the others. Therefore, they share the same spatial metadata, and each is required to correctly interpret the others.

For the use of HDF5, the following key concepts (<<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=5.1>>) are important:

_File_:: a contiguous string of bytes in a computer store (memory, disk, etc.), and the bytes represent zero or more objects of the model;

_Group_:: a collection of objects (including groups);

_Dataset_:: a multidimensional array of data elements with attributes and other metadata;

_Dataspace_:: a description of the dimensions of a multidimensional array;

_Datatype_:: a description of a specific class of data element including its storage layout as a pattern of bits; (Enumerations are encoded with unsigned 8-bit or unsigned 16-bit indices, depending on the number of transported values.)

_Attribute_:: a named data value associated with a group, dataset, or named datatype and stored as a scalar;

_Property List_:: a collection of parameters (some permanent and some transient) controlling options in the library.

In addition, datasets may be a compound (a single record consisting of an array of simple value types) and have multiple dimensions.

[[subsec-product-structure]]
=== Product structure
The structure of the data product follows the form given in <<iho-s100,part=10c>> -- HDF5 Data Model and File Format. The general structure, which was designed for several S-100 products is given in <<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>>.

[[fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure]]
.Outline of the generic data file structure
image::../images/figure-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure.png[UML diagram depicting the generic data file structure as described between this figure and the table Overview of S-102 Data Product]

<<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>> shows the four levels defined within the HDF encoding as defined in <<iho-s100,part=10c>>. Below is a further definition of these levels.

*Level 1*:: At the top level lies the Root Group, and it contains the Root Metadata and two subsidiary groups. The Root Metadata applies to all S-100 type products.

*Level 2*:: The next Level contains the Feature Information Group and the Feature Container Group. The Feature Information Group contains the feature *BathymetryCoverage*, the feature attribute codes and the optional feature *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage*. The Feature Container Group contains the Feature Metadata and one or more Feature Instance Groups.

*Level 3*:: This level contains one or more Feature Instance groups. A *BathymetryCoverage* feature instance is a bathymetric gridded data set for a single region and at a single vertical datum. A *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* feature instance is a corresponding dataset for the same single region and for all applicable vertical datums.

*Level 4*:: This level contains the actual data for each feature. In S-102 *BathymetryCoverage* and *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* each use the *ValuesGroup* to define the content. The other groups at this level are not used.

In <<tab-overview-of-s102-data-product>> below, levels refer to HDF5 structuring (see <<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>>). Naming in each box below the header line is as follows: Generic name; S-100 or S-102 name, or nothing if none; and (_HDF5 type_) group, attribute or attribute list, or dataset. <<fig-hierarchy-of-s102-data-product>> depicts the same structure using a graphical representation.

The following sections explain entries in <<tab-overview-of-s102-data-product>> in greater detail.

==== Root Group

The root group is required by HDF5. The S-100 HDF5 format (<<iho-s100,part=10c>>) attaches metadata attributes applicable to the whole dataset to this group. S-102 uses all the S-100 attributes except _geographicIdentifier_ and _metaFeatures_. The attributes used in S-102 are listed in <<tab-root-group-attributes>>, with specific requirements, if any, added in the Remarks column.

[[note1]]
[NOTE]
====
The _productIdentifier_ ("S-102") and _version_ fields (X.X.X) of S100_ProductSpecification must be used.
====

[[note2]]
[NOTE]
====
The value _horizontalCRS_ specifies the horizontal Coordinate Reference System. At the time of writing, S-100 does not yet provide a mechanism for this value's definition within HDF5 encoding (such as an enumeration of horizontal CRSs). Consequently, this configuration causes a deviation from S-100. The horizontal datum is implicitly defined by this CRS because each horizontal CRS consists of a coordinate system and a datum. S-102 does not use "user defined" CRS as mentioned in <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=6>>.
====


[[note3]]
[NOTE]
====
The baseCRS is the geodetic CRS on which the projected CRS is based. In particular, the datum of the base CRS is also used for the derived CRS (see <<iho-s100,part=6,table=6>>).
====


[[note12]]
[NOTE]
====
This is the default vertical datum. If and only if a *BathymetryCoverage* feature instance group does not specify a vertical datum, this (Root Group) vertical datum shall apply.
====

==== Feature Codes (Group_F)
No attributes.

This group specifies the S-100 features to which the data applies, and consists of three components:

*featureCode* -- a 1-dimensional dataset with the featureCode(s) of the S-100 feature(s) contained in the data product. For S-102, the dataset has only two elements -- the string "*BathymetryCoverage*" and "*QualityOfBathymetryCoverage*" (without quotes). The entries in this dataset give the names of the other two components of Group_F.

*BathymetryCoverage* -- A 1-dimensional dataset that contains the standard definition of the bathymetry coverage feature class in terms of its attributes and their types, units of measure, etc. The datatype of its elements is the compound type described in <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=8>>.

*QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* -- A 1-dimensional dataset of the same datatype as the *BathymetryCoverage* dataset described above. This *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* dataset contains the definition of the reference to metadata records. The reference is a single integer which identifies a metadata record in _featureAttributeTable_ (described in <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.6.2>> and <<root-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage>>.

//QualityOfBathymetricData is defined in the GI Registry as “An area within which a uniform assessment of the quality of the bathymetric data exists.” That does not describe this dataset, which provides information at the level of individual cells. Recommend new type QualityOfSurveyCoverage or QualityOfBathymetryCoverage, defined as “A set of references to value records that provide localised information about depths, uncertainties, and survey metadata.” It can be proposed to the GI Registry after the S-102 team approves it. (RM comment 23Jan2023)

==== BathymetryCoverage and QualityOfBathymetryCoverage Tables (in Group_F)

BathymetryCoverage and QualityOfBathymetryCoverage are arrays of compound type elements, whose components are the 8 components specified in <<tab-sample-contents-of-the-BathymetryCoverage-and-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage-arrays>>.

According to <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.5>>, "All the numeric values in the feature description dataset are string representations of numeric values; for example, "-9999.0" not the float value -9999.0."

While the sample contents are shown in the two attributes columns, these are actually rows in the BathymetryCoverage table. They are also each a single HDF5 compound type and represent a single HDF5 element in the table.

All cells shall be HDF5 variable length strings. The minimum and maximum values are stored in lower and upper columns. Variable length strings allow future proofing the format in the event editing is allowed or correcting these values is required.

The number depends on the number of different vertical datums in the Feature Container Group.
====

[[subsec-BathymetryCoverage-feature-instance]]
==== Feature Instance group -- BathymetryCoverage.nn
The BathymetryCoverage Feature Container Group can contain one or more Feature Instance Groups. The naming of the Feature Instance Groups follows the notation specified by the S-100. For generalization, the numbering is indicated with ".nn".

Each feature instance group implements a unique vertical datum. All feature instance groups must share the same spatial location and extent. For each feature instance group, only the grid cells falling within the area of validity for that feature instance group's vertical datum should be populated with (real) data. Within that feature instance group, all other grid cells should be populated with the fill value. Therefore, it is expected that:

* The only grid cells that should be populated in more than one feature instance group are those that fall along a vertical datum boundary.

* Where multiple population occurs, the ECDIS should choose the set of values resulting in the most conservative description to the mariner. (I.e., it should choose the shoalest adjusted depth.)

As derived from <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.7>> and <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=12>>, <<tab-structure-of-bathymetrycoverage-feature-instance-group>> and <<tab-attributes-of-bathymetrycoverage-feature-instance-group>> describe the structure and attributes, respectively, of the *BathymetryCoverage* feature instance group.

|===

The _gridOriginLongitude_, _gridOriginLatitude_, _gridSpacingLongitudinal_, and _gridSpacingLatitudinal_ attributes should be in the same geographic units as the bounding box. Note that this practice deviates from S-100 where it indicates that this value should be in Arc Degrees.

_numPointsLongitude_ and _numPointsLatitude_ must contain the number of cells in the x and y dimensions of the values table.

The S-102 uses the "Overriding of Attributes" concept of the <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.7.1>>. This usage allows the feature instance group to overwrite the attributes of a higher group, in this case the _verticalDatum_. The default vertical datum is specified in the root group (see <<tab-root-group-attributes>>). The feature instance group for this default vertical datum must not use the additional attributes _verticalDatum_ and _verticalDatumReference_ (on the feature instance group).

[[mvdvdr]]
If multiple vertical datums are present in the product, a separate feature instance group must be created for each vertical datum. These feature instance groups must use the additional attribute _verticalDatum_ (on the feature instance group).

_Note: At present, this Product Specification does not allow values other than *1: s100VerticalDatum* for *verticalDatumReference*. However, if future changes allow the value of *2: EPSG* (and if the value at the feature instance group differs from what is contained in the Root Group), then this value would become mandatory._

[[para-domain-extent-polygon]]
According to S-100, either the BoundingBox at the Feature Instance Group or the _domainExtent.polygon_ must be specified. If _domainExtent.polygon_ is specified, the BoundingBox is not specified in this case. The grid cells that do not belong to the area of the respective vertical datum should be assigned the fill value. If more than one _domainExtent.polygon_ is used, those of different feature instance groups should not overlap. At positions where the polygons of different Feature Instance groups touch, the edges should be identical. The _domainExtent.polygon_ does not have to follow grid cell boundaries but is an independent vector geometry based on the _SoundingDatum_ surface from S-101. The _domainExtent.polygon_ only supports a simple polygon geometry in accordance with <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=11>>. The mapping of multi-polygons and inner rings is not possible.

==== The values group -- Group_001
This group contains 5 attributes, all of which are mandatory. According to <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=19>>, _timePoint_ applies because the _dataCodingFormat_ = _2_.
The other four attributes for this group are an extension of this Product Specification and, thus, are not defined by <<iho-s100,part=10c>>. <<tab-attributes-of-values-group>> lists all 5 attributes.

The group contains an HDF5 dataset named values containing the bathymetric gridded data.

[[subsec-BathymetryCoverage-feature-instance-group-values-dataset]]
==== BathymetryCoverage feature instance group -- values dataset

This dataset contains the compound data arrays containing bathymetric gridded data. These components are explained below.

For bathymetric gridded data, the dataset includes a two-dimensional array containing always the depth and under certain conditions uncertainty data. These dimensions are defined by _numPointsLongitudinal_ and _numPointsLatitudinal_. By knowing the grid origin and the grid spacing, the position of every grid point and grid cell can be simply computed.

If the _uncertainty_ for each grid cell is equal, it is not necessary to store it at each cell in the grid. The uniqueness of the uncertainty results from the equality of the attributes _minimumUncertainty_ and _maximumUncertainty_ of Group_001 of the BathymetryCoverage (see <<tab-attributes-of-values-group>> No. 3 & 4). If the uncertainty values at the grid cells are omitted, it must be ensured that the entry of the _uncertainty_ of the BathymetryCoverage in the Group_F is also omitted (see <<tab-sample-contents-of-the-BathymetryCoverage-and-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage-arrays>>). This type of storage technique can reduce the amount of memory required for the uncertainty without loss of information. The uncertainty of each grid cell can be immediately obtained from the _minimumUncertainty_ or _maximumUncertainty_ attributes of Group_001 of the BathymetryCoverage.

If the _uncertainty_ is not the same for each grid cell, it must be stored at each cell in the grid. For unknown or unused uncertainty data, it must be filled with the _fillValue_ specified in the Group_F feature information dataset.

The grid cell values are stored in two-dimensional arrays with a prescribed number of columns (_numCOL_) and rows (_numROW_). This grid is defined as a regular grid (_dataCodingFormat_ = 2); therefore, the _depth_ and _uncertainty_ values will be for each cell in the grid. The data type of the array values is a compound with one or two members.

[[root-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage]]
==== Root QualityOfBathymetryCoverage

The QualityOfBathymetryCoverage container group has the same metadata attributes as BathymetryCoverage container group (see <<tab-attributes-of-bathymetrycoverage-feature-container-group>>). The values of the attributes must also be the same as the BathymetryCoverage container group. An exception is the attribute _dataCodingFormat_, which must be '9'. The use of multiple BathymetryCoverage Feature Instance groups (different Vertical Datums) does not affect the multiplicity of the QualityOfBathymetryCoverage, which remains 0 to 1. This means that the different BathymetryCoverage Feature Instance groups share a common QualityOfBathymetryCoverage.

The QualityOfBathymetryCoverage container group contains an additional 1-dimensional array named featureAttributeTable (<<iho-s100,part=10c,table=9>>; <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.6.2>>). This dataset is mandatory within the QualityOfBathymetryCoverage group. Each element of this array is a metadata record of HDF5 compound type. The fields are described in <<tab-elements-of-featureAttributeTable-compound-datatype>> below.

//(1) Are these fields mandatory? (2) Can producers add other fields like surveyType and line spacing? (RM comment 4Jan2023)
//All optional except id. Producers should not add other fields. (RM comment 23Jan2023)

[NOTE]
====
A feature in this context is any object, whether manmade or not, projecting above the sea floor, which may be a danger for surface navigation <<iho-s44>>. Least depth of detected features measured does not describe the least depth of features that were actually detected during a hydrographic survey, but the ability of the survey to detect the least depth of features with a maximum uncertainty as defined in <<iho-s44>>.

====
A feature in this context is any object, whether manmade or not, projecting above the sea floor, which may be a danger for surface navigation <<iho-s44>>.

[[subsec-note6]]
[NOTE]
====
The role of the attribute, _featureSizeVar_ is described in <<qualityAndSourceMetadata>>. The expectation is that _featureSizeVar_ will be set to zero if the feature size does not scale with depth. As with _featureSize_, _featureSizeVar_ should be ignored if _significantFeatures_ is False.
====

[[subsec-note7]]
[NOTE]
====
When both _featureSize_ and _featureSizeVar_ are present, the greater of the two should be considered valid.
====

[[subsec-note8]]
[NOTE]
====
Full seafloor coverage achieved applies to both the spatial completeness of feature detection and to the spatial completeness of the measurement of the regular seafloor. The former is further specified by the complex attribute features detected; the latter by the attributes depth range maximum value and depth range minimum value.
====

[[subsec-note9]]
[NOTE]
====
The attribute _bathyCoverage_ is especially useful in side-scan surveys which are characterized by gaps in bathymetric observations with full coverage side-scan imagery. In this case, interpolated gaps between bathymetry coverage would show _fullSeafloorCoverageAchieved_ = True and _bathyCoverage_ = False. However, if _fullSeafloorCoverageAchieved_ = False, _bathyCoverage_ must also equal False (e.g., gaps between single beam echosounder data without correlating side-scan sonar coverage).

The QualityOfBathymetryCoverage.01 instance group has the same metadata attributes as BathymetryCoverage.01 instance group (see <<tab-attributes-of-bathymetrycoverage-feature-instance-group>>). The values of the attributes must also be the same as the BathymetryCoverage instance group.

==== Values group for QualityOfBathymetryCoverage
The values group for QualityOfBathymetryCoverage contains no metadata attributes and a single dataset named values, which is described in <<subsec-values-dataset-for-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage>>.

[[subsec-values-dataset-for-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage]]
==== Values dataset for QualityOfBathymetryCoverage
The values dataset for QualityOfBathymetryCoverage is a single two-dimensional array of unsigned integers (the same datatype and size as the “id” field in featureAttributeTable — <<tab-attributes-of-values-group>>). The array must have the same dimensions as the values dataset in the BathymetryCoverage feature instance (<<subsec-BathymetryCoverage-feature-instance-group-values-dataset>>).

Each cell in this values dataset must be populated with a value that is one of the record identifiers in the featureAttributeTable dataset or with the fill value 0 (zero).

==== Mandatory Naming Conventions

The following group and attribute names are mandatory in S-100:

* Group_F
* featureCode

[[sec-data-product-delivery]]
== Data Product Delivery

=== Introduction
This clause describes how S-102 data will be delivered from the charting authority to the mariner.

*Units of Delivery*:: Exchange Set

*Transfer Size*:: See <<subsec-dataset-size>>.

*Medium Name*:: Digital Data Delivery

*Other Delivery Information*::
+
--
Each dataset must be contained in a physically separate, uniquely identified file on the transfer medium.

Each exchange set has a single exchange catalogue which contains the discovery metadata for each dataset.

An exchange set is encapsulated into a form suitable for transmission by a mapping called an encoding. An encoding translates each of the elements of the exchange set into a logical form suitable for writing to media and for transmission online. An encoding may also define other elements in addition to the exchange set contents (This is media identification, data extents etc. ...) and may define commercial constructs such as encryption and compression methods.

If the data is transformed in S-102 it must not be changed.

This Product Specification defines the encoding which must be used as a default for transmission of data between parties.

The encoding encapsulates exchange set elements as follows:

*Mandatory Elements*

* S-102 datasets -- HDF encoding
* Exchange Catalogue -- the XML encoded representation of exchange set catalogue features [discovery metadata].

*Optional Elements*

* S-102 Feature Catalogue -- If it is necessary to deliver the latest Feature Catalogue to the end user it may be done using the S-102 exchange set mechanism for datasets
* S-102 Portrayal Catalogue -- If it is necessary to deliver the latest Portrayal Catalogue to the end user it may be done using the S-102 exchange set mechanism for datasets.
--

=== Dataset

==== Dataset management
Three types of dataset files may be produced and contained within an exchange set:

* New dataset: Initial.
* New edition of a dataset: Includes new information. New editions must cover at least the same area as its predecessor.
* [[canc]]Cancellation: The dataset is cancelled and no longer available to be displayed or used.

[[subsec-production-of-a-cancellation]]
===== Production of a cancellation
S-102 uses only the fileless cancellation method described in <<iho-s100,part=17,clause=17-4.4.1>>. In order to cancel a dataset, the cancelling authority (generally the producer of the original dataset) must:

1. Prepare an exchange catalogue with an S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata block with field values as described in <<subsec-metadata-for-cancellation>>.
2. Complete other parts of the exchange catalogue as required by <<subsec-s100_exchangecatalogue>> (for example, provide discovery metadata for a replacement dataset if such is included in the same exchange set).
3. Sign and distribute the exchange catalogue in a normally structured exchange set.

[[subsec-metadata-for-cancellation]]
===== Metadata for cancellation
S-102 uses only the fileless cancellation method described in <<iho-s100,part=17,clause=17-4.4.1>>. For a cancellation, set:

* _fileName_ = _fileName_ of the cancelled dataset

* _purpose_ = _cancellation_

* issueDate and issueTime = the issue date and time of the cancellation

* _replacedData_ = _true_ if and only if the cancelled dataset is replaced by another dataset; otherwise _false_. This attribute must be populated for a cancellation.

* _dataReplacement_ = _fileName_ of the replacement dataset (if and only if the cancelled dataset is replaced by another dataset). This attribute must be populated when _replacedData_=_true_.

* all other mandatory attributes to the same values as in the discovery metadata block for the dataset being cancelled.

[[subsec-dataset-size]]
==== Dataset size
S-102 delivery will take place in one form: network transfer to platform (that is, internet download). An example scenario has been provided below:

NOTE: The use of 10 MB in this and other sections should be treated as informative information only. Additionally, any computed values associated with either file size limit should be treated as approximate answers. Final selection of an appropriate file size limit or grid resolution is left to the discretion of the data producer.

*Network Transfer*:: To minimize overall file size, the HO produces a 10 MB file for wireless transmission to marine vessels. In uncompressed form, this file would contain roughly 600 by 600 grid cells.

<<tab-informative-grid-resolution-and-resulting-tile-size-at-chart-scale>> provides general information to aid in the compilation of S-102 data for specific charting scales.

[[subsec-dataset-file-naming]]
==== Dataset file naming
Dataset naming must follow a standard pattern to give implementers greater predictability of incoming datasets (see <<iho-s100,part=17,clause=4.3>>). S-102 dataset naming conventions must follow these rules.

*102YYYYØØØØØØØØØØØØ.H5*::
102::: the first 3 characters identify the dataset as an S-102 dataset (mandatory).
YYYY::: the fourth to seventh characters identify the producer code according to the Producer Code Register.
ØØØØ::: the eighth to the maximum nineteenth characters are optional and may be used in any way by the producer to provide the unique file name. The following characters are allowed in the dataset name: A to Z, 0 to 9 and the special character _ (underscore).
H5::: denotes an HDF5 file.

=== Exchange Set
The structure of an S-102 Exchange Set must be according to the structure described below, which is based on <<iho-s100,part=17,clause=4.2>>.

. An S-102 Exchange Set must contain an Exchange Set Catalogue, CATALOG.XML, its digital signature CATALOG.SIGN, and may contain any number of S-102 conformant dataset files, support files, and Catalogue files.

. All content must be placed inside a top root folder named S100_ROOT. This is the only top level root folder in an Exchange Set containing only S-100 products.

. The S100_ROOT folder must contain a subfolder named S-102. This subfolder holds content specific to the S-102 Product Specification.

. The S-102 subfolder must contain subfolders for the component dataset files (DATASET_FILES) and Catalogues (CATALOGUES) as required.

. The required Exchange Set Catalogue XML document instance must be named CATALOG.XML and placed in the S100_ROOT folder, together with its digital signature (CATALOG.SIGN) file. All other digital signatures are included within their corresponding resource metadata records in the CATALOG.XML.

. Support files are not allowed in S-102 exchange sets for this edition of S-102.

=== Exchange Catalogue
The Exchange Catalogue acts as the table of contents for the Exchange Set. The Catalogue file of the Exchange Set must be named CATALOG.XML. No other file in the Exchange Set may be named CATALOG.XML. The contents of the Exchange Catalogue are described in <<sec-metadata>>.

=== Data integrity and encryption
<<iho-s100,part=15>> defines the algorithms for compressing, encrypting and digitally signing datasets based on the S-100 Data Model. The individual Product Specifications provide details about which of the elements are being used and on which files in the dataset.

==== Use of compression
The data producer decides if compression will be used on the S-102 product files (HDF5). It is expected that a hydrographic office will make a policy decision and that all the S-102 datasets from the producer will be either compressed or uncompressed.

It is recommended to compress all the dataset files, for example HDF5 files. The ZIP compression method defined in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=5.2>> must be applied to the product files.

==== Use of data protection
It is recommended to encrypt all the dataset files, for example HDF5. The encryption method defined in <<iho-s100,part=15>> must be applied.

==== Use of digital signatures
Digital signatures shall be used on all files included in a S-102 compliant Exchange Set to meet the requirements of IMO resolution MSC.428(98) to reduce cyber security risks among users, especially when used in navigations systems at sea. The recommended signature method is defined in <<iho-s100,part=15>>.

The digital signature information is encoded in the corresponding discovery block in the exchange catalogue for each file included in the Exchange Set.


[[sec-metadata]]
== Metadata

//Since S-102 now describes a “navigation product” intended for ECDIS use: (a) ISO metadata files are not needed - ECDIS doesn’t have to read them; and (b) any “extra” metadata (metadata not defined in Part 17) should, at least in this edition, *not* be added to the exchange catalogue. If such extra metadata *has* to be provided, it should be as HDF5 attributes in the root group. (RM Comment 23Jan2023)

//With the removal of ISO metadata files, the metadata attributes in the old Sections 12.2 (Discovery metadata) and 12.3 (Structure metadata) are not encoded anywhere and these clauses have been deleted. The attributes depthCorrectionType and verticalUncertaintyType are also not encoded anywhere in the “navigation” version of S-102. (RM Comment 20 Mar 2023)

=== Introduction
The Metadata elements used in the Bathymetric Surface product are derived from S-100 and from <<iso-19115-1>> and <<iso-19115-2>>. Optionally additional metadata may be derived from <<iso-ts-19130>> and <<iso-ts-19130-2>> especially metadata relating to the sonar equipment which may have been used to acquire the bathymetric data.

S-102 metadata is encoded in two places:

* Metadata used for the discovery, identification, and use of S-102 datasets in S-100-based navigations systems (specifically, an S-100-capable ECDIS) is encoded in the exchange catalogue. This metadata conforms to S-100 Part 17, with product-specific restrictions added.

* Metadata required by the S-100 HDF5 encoding (<<iho-s100,part=10c>>) and product-specific metadata defined by this product specification are encoded at various levels in the HDF5 group hierarchy, as specified by <<iho-s100,part=10c>> or <<subsec-product-structure>>.

[[subsec-exchange-set-metadata]]
=== Exchange Set metadata
For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata required: metadata about the overall Exchange Catalogue, metadata about each of the datasets contained in the Catalogue.

<<fig-components-and-associated-metadata-for-the-s102-exchange-set>> depicts the relationships of exchange set elements (datasets and feature/portrayal catalogues) and exchange set metadata. This figure is derived from <<iho-s100,part=17,figure=2>> with relationships not applicable to S-102 omitted.

<<fig-relationship-between-exchange-catalogue-discovery-metadata-and-dataset>> depicts the structure of the exchange catalogue and its component discovery metadata blocks. The structure is the same as in <<iho-s100,part=17>>.

More detailed information about the various classes is shown in <<fig-s102-exchange-set-class-details>> with further description in <<tab-s100-datasetDiscoveryMetadata-params;to!sec-pt-locale>>. In the cases in which classes are used without modification, refer to <<iho-s100,part=17>> for their descriptions.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable important information about the datasets to be examined without the need to process the data (e.g., decryption, decompression, loading). Other Catalogues can be included in the Exchange Set in support of the datasets such as Feature and Portrayal.

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed for S-102. In some cases, the metadata may be repeated in a national language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

The XML schemas for S-102 exchange catalogues will be available from the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry and/or the S-100 GitHub site (link:++https://github.com/IHO-S100WG++[]).

The S-102 exchange catalogue uses the S-100 exchange catalogue schemas which are available from the S-100 schema server at link:++https://schemas.s100dev.net++[] (downloadable archives are also available on the site for offline use). Implementation of the S-102-specific constraints described in following clauses below is left to developer decision as it can be done in various ways depending on implementation frameworks and the requirements of production or application software.

=== Language

The exchange language must be English.

Character strings must be encoded using the character set defined in <<iso-10646-1>>, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8). A BOM (byte order mark) must not be used.

=== S100_ExchangeCatalogue

Each Exchange Set has a single S100_ExchangeCatalogue which contains meta information for the data in the Exchange Set.

S-102 uses S100_ExchangeCatalogue without modification.


==== S100_ExchangeCatalogueIdentifier
S-102 uses S100_ExchangeCatalogueIdentifier without modification.

==== S100_CataloguePointOfContact
S-102 uses S100_CataloguePointOfContact without modification.

=== S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata
Dataset discovery metadata in S-102 restricts certain attributes and roles as described in <<tab-s100-datasetDiscoveryMetadata-params>>. Optional S-100 attributes which are mandatory in S-102 are indicated in the Remarks column.

S-102 exchange sets conforming to this edition of S-102 and using a CRS from the EPSG registry may be encoded as category 3 or 4 when the _compliancyCategory_ metadata attribute is populated. Because S-98 interoperability assumes _category4_ datasets, _category4_ may be used for test purposes, though the absence of test datasets and of a published IHO interoperability catalogue mean this edition of S-102 does not yet qualify for _category4_. *Given the uncertainty about interoperability testing requirements and availability of test datasets, the S-100 WG chair and S-102 PT chair should be consulted for up-to-date guidance.*

[[sec-certs-digsign]]
=== Certificates and Digital Signatures
The classes S100_SE_CertificateContainerType (<<iho-s100,part=15,clause=8.11.1>>), S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference (<<iho-s100,part=15,clause=8.11.7>>), and S100_SE_DigitalSignature are defined in <<iho-s100,part=15>> and implemented in the S-100 generic schemas.

In accordance with <<iho-s100,part=15>>, only the ECDSA algorithm is allowed from the S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference enumeration.

S-102 uses S100_SE_DigitalSignature without modification. As stated in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=15-8.11.3>>:

"The class S100_SE_DigitalSignature is realized as one of either S100_SE_SignatureOnData (a digital signature of a particular identified resource) or an additional digital signature defined using the class S100_SE_AdditionalSignature, each of which is either a S100_SE_SignatureOnData or S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature element as described in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=8.8>>. <<iho-s100,part=17>> metadata thus allows for multiple digital signatures, a single mandatory S100_SE_SignatureOnData and any number of additional signatures, either of the data or other signatures."
