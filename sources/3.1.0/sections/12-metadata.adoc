== Metadata

//Since S-102 now describes a “navigation product” intended for ECDIS use: (a) ISO metadata files are not needed - ECDIS doesn’t have to read them; and (b) any “extra” metadata (metadata not defined in Part 17) should, at least in this edition, *not* be added to the exchange catalogue. If such extra metadata *has* to be provided, it should be as HDF5 attributes in the root group. (RM Comment 23Jan2023)

//With the removal of ISO metadata files, the metadata attributes in the old Sections 12.2 (Discovery metadata) and 12.3 (Structure metadata) are not encoded anywhere and these clauses have been deleted. The attributes depthCorrectionType and verticalUncertaintyType are also not encoded anywhere in the “navigation” version of S-102. (RM Comment 20 Mar 2023)

=== Introduction
The Metadata elements used in the Bathymetric Surface product are derived from S-100 and from <<iso-19115-1>> and <<iso-19115-2>>. Optionally additional metadata may be derived from <<iso-ts-19130>> and <<iso-ts-19130-2>> especially metadata relating to the sonar equipment which may have been used to acquire the bathymetric data.

S-102 metadata is encoded in two places:

* Metadata used for the discovery, identification, and use of S-102 datasets in S-100-based navigations systems (specifically, an S-100-capable ECDIS) is encoded in the exchange catalogue. This metadata conforms to S-100 Part 17, with product-specific restrictions added.

* Metadata required by the S-100 HDF5 encoding (<<iho-s100,part=10c>>) and product-specific metadata defined by this product specification are encoded at various levels in the HDF5 group hierarchy, as specified by <<iho-s100,part=10c>> or <<subsec-product-structure>>.

[[subsec-exchange-set-metadata]]
=== Exchange Set metadata
For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata required: metadata about the overall Exchange Catalogue, metadata about each of the datasets contained in the Catalogue.

<<fig-components-and-associated-metadata-for-the-s102-exchange-set>> depicts the relationships of exchange set elements (datasets and feature/portrayal catalogues) and exchange set metadata. This figure is derived from <<iho-s100,part=17,figure=2>> with relationships not applicable to S-102 omitted.

<<fig-relationship-between-exchange-catalogue-discovery-metadata-and-dataset>> depicts the structure of the exchange catalogue and its component discovery metadata blocks. The structure is the same as in <<iho-s100,part=17>>.

More detailed information about the various classes is shown in <<fig-s102-exchange-set-class-details>> with further description in <<tab-s100-datasetDiscoveryMetadata-params;to!sec-pt-locale>>. In the cases in which classes are used without modification, refer to <<iho-s100,part=17>> for their descriptions.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable important information about the datasets to be examined without the need to process the data (e.g., decryption, decompression, loading). Other Catalogues can be included in the Exchange Set in support of the datasets such as Feature and Portrayal.

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed for S-102. In some cases, the metadata may be repeated in a national language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

The XML schemas for S-102 exchange catalogues will be available from the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry and/or the S-100 GitHub site (https://github.com/IHO-S100WG).

The S-102 exchange catalogue uses the S-100 exchange catalogue schemas which are available from the S-100 schema server at https://schemas.s100dev.net (downloadable archives are also available on the site for offline use). Implementation of the S-102-specific constraints described in following clauses below is left to developer decision as it can be done in various ways depending on implementation frameworks and the requirements of production or application software.

=== Language

The exchange language must be English.

Character strings must be encoded using the character set defined in <<iso-10646-1>>, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8). A BOM (byte order mark) must not be used.

=== S100_ExchangeCatalogue

=== S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata
Dataset discovery metadata in S-102 restricts certain attributes and roles as described in <<tab-s100-datasetDiscoveryMetadata-params>>. Optional S-100 attributes which are mandatory in S-102 are indicated in the Remarks column.

In accordance with <<iho-s100,part=15>>, only the ECDSA algorithm is allowed from the S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference enumeration.

S-102 uses S100_SE_DigitalSignature without modification. As stated in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=15-8.11.3>>:

"The class S100_SE_DigitalSignature is realized as one of either S100_SE_SignatureOnData (a digital signature of a particular identified resource) or an additional digital signature defined using the class S100_SE_AdditionalSignature, each of which is either a S100_SE_SignatureOnData or S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature element as described in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=8.8>>. <<iho-s100,part=17>> metadata thus allows for multiple digital signatures, a single mandatory S100_SE_SignatureOnData and any number of additional signatures, either of the data or other signatures."
