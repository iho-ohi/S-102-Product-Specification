=== Feature Attributes

==== BathymetryCoverage

.BathymetryCoverage feature attribute parameters
[cols="a"]
|===

|IHO Definition: *depth*. The vertical distance from a given water level to the bottom [<<iho-s32>>].

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* Drying heights (drying depths) are indicated by a negative value.

|IHO Definition: *uncertainty*. Estimate characterising the range of values within which the true value of a measurement is expected to lie as defined within a particular confidence level. It is expressed as a positive value.

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* Represents a +/- value defining the possible range of associated depth.
* Expressed as a positive number.
