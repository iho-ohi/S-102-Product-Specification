=== Introduction
S-102 portrayal is intended to contribute to the safe operation of an S-100 based marine navigation system by:

* Ensuring display of bathymetric surfaces, standards of colours, and their assignment to depths;
* Ensuring the display is clear and unambiguous;
* Establishing an accepted pattern for presentation that becomes familiar to mariners and so can be recognized instantly without confusion; and
* Utilizing the S-100 portrayal model to ensure interoperability.

To ensure that presentation remains intuitive, the following principles must be followed when changes are made to the S-102 Portrayal Catalogue:

* S-102 must maintain equivalence in terms of alerts and indications functionality in ECDIS;
* The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue should be modified by extension. Portrayal rules should be retained for items that have been superseded in the current version of S-102. This retention ensures that S-102 data produced to previous versions can be displayed using the latest Portrayal Catalogue.

S-102 portrayal is covered by the portrayal model as defined in S-100. This model reflects how the Portrayal Catalogue is defined for use in marine navigation systems.

S-102 uses the portrayal processes defined in <<iho-s100,part=9>> and <<iho-s100,part=9a>>. Items included in the S-102 Portrayal Catalogue must be registered in the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry.

|===

The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue contains the mechanisms for the system to portray information found in S-102 bathymetric surfaces. The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue contains the following types of mechanisms and structures:

* Set of portrayal rules;
* Set of colour profiles.

The Portrayal Catalogue model is defined in <<iho-s100,part=9,clause=9-13>>. The S-102 Portrayal Catalogue is available in an XML document, which conforms to the S-100 XML Portrayal Catalogue Schema. The structure for the Portrayal Catalogue is described in <<iho-s100,part=9,clause=9-13.2>>.

<<fig-s52-depth-zone-colouring-for-day>> is included to illustrate informative depth zone colouring as adapted from S-52. More comprehensive portrayal details can be found in the S-102 Portrayal Catalogue, which is available in the IHO GI Registry (as detailed in <<tab-s102-portrayal-catalogue-citation-info>>).

==== Use of sun-illumination
S-102 data can be visualized as a sun-illuminated or static (flat) dataset. The depiction of sun-illumination requires the entry of a sun azimuth and corresponding elevation. <<fig-sun-illuminated-and-static-flat-shading>> shows the difference between a sun-illuminated and static (flat) surface.

NOTE: Although sun-illumination provides marked benefit to the user, it is not currently supported by S-100. As such, it is advisable for ECDIS manufacturers to implement the facility of sun-illumination in order to make such a benefit available.


Informative values for sun azimuth angle and elevation have been provided in <<tab-sun-azimuth-and-elevation-values>> below.

Both views show varying gray shades as depth varies by a large amount. The left view is labeled _Sun-Illuminated_ and also shows hillshade effects according to all depth variation. The right view is labeled _Flat_ and shows no hillshading.]
