== Data Maintenance

=== Maintenance and update frequency
Datasets are maintained by replacement on a dataset basis. That is, the entire data product and the associated metadata are replaced as a unit. This is unlike vector data that may be updated incrementally. Also, each replacement data set must have its own digital signature.

=== Data source
Data producers must use applicable sources to maintain and update data and provide a brief description of the sources that were used to produce the dataset.

=== Production process
Data Producers should follow their established production processes for maintaining and updating datasets.
