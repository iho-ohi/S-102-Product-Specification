== Data Content and Structure

=== Introduction
The Bathymetric Surface Product incorporates aspects of the Navigation Surface concept where in addition to estimation of depth, an optional estimate of the uncertainty associated with the depth can be computed and preserved. <<fig-overview-structure-s102>> below shows a high-level overview of the structure of S-102. It shows that the Bathymetric Surface Product consists of a set of data comprising the HDF5 datasets plus a Digital Certification Block. The Digital Certification Block is mandatory so that the user can trace whether the data has been certified. The HDF5 file consists of metadata (spatial, feature and discovery) and collocated coverages consisting of depth and uncertainty values. S-102 uses the S-100 Data Protection Scheme to ensure certification and authentication.

Thus, the Bathymetric Surface Product is a hybrid of coverages, as defined in <<iho-s100,part=8>>, and metadata packages as defined in <<iho-s100,part=4>>. This is described in <<subsec-application-schema>>.

=== Application Schema
The Application Schema Data Set Structure is shown in <<fig-data-set-structure-s102>> and <<fig-coverage-structure-of-s102>>. They show a number of classes specialized for use in S-102 and two sets of implementation classes. An actual data set of S-102 bathymetry data only contains the implementation classes. All of the required attributes from the other classes in the application schema are satisfied by statements within the Product Specification. This approach to producing the Application Schema results in a very simple structure for implementation.

The model in <<fig-data-set-structure-s102>> states that:

* An S-102 data set (*S102_DataSet*), which is inherited from *S100_DataSet*, references an S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection (*S102_IGCollection*). In S-100 it is possible to have multiple collections but in S-102 only one is needed to hold the bathymetry coverage. The S-102 discovery metadata class (*S102_DiscoveryMetadata*) describes the metadata entities required for the identification of the entire data set. The required discovery metadata is implemented through the *S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata* class defined in <<iho-s100,part=17>>.

* An instance of an S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection (*S102_IGCollection*) which is a subtype of *S100_IGCollection*, is described by a set of S-102 Collection Metadata (*S102_CollectionMetadata*). This relationship is 1 to 1 meaning that there is one set of collection metadata for each instance of *S102_IGCollection*. There is a large choice of metadata that may be used in an S-100 compliant data product. Only a small amount of this metadata is mandated by <<iso-19115-1>> for discovery. This edition of S-102 neither uses ISO metadata files nor extends S-100 generic metadata and therefore *S102_CollectionMetadata*, *S102_StructuralMetadata*, *S100_QualityMetadata*, and *S102_AcquisitionMetadata* are abstract classes as in S-100 Part 8 Figure 8-27. This edition of S-102 uses the dataset metadata elements defined in <<iho-s100,part=17>> and <<iho-s100,part=10c>> with restrictions defined in this product specification. The metadata elements defined in <<iho-s100,part=17>> are encoded in a discovery block within the exchange catalogue (<<iho-s100,part=12,clause=12.6>> to <<iho-s100,part=12,clause=12.10>>), and the metadata elements defined in <<iho-s100,part=10c>> are encoded as attributes and datasets within the HDF5 file (<<iho-s100,part=12,clause=10.2>>). The conceptual structure of coverage features in an S-102 dataset is discussed further in <<subsec-application-schema-implementation-classes>>.

.Coverage Structure of S-102
image::../images/figure-coverage-structure-of-s102.png[UML diagram depicting the Application Schema Coverage Structure as described between this figure and Application Schema implementation classes]

The model in <<fig-coverage-structure-of-s102>> depicts the coverage type in this application schema: 

* The coverage type is a continuous Regular Grid Coverage called *S102_DepthCoverage* which inherits from (*S100_GridCoverage*). Many of the parameters of the coverage are described in the product specification.

[[subsec-application-schema-implementation-classes]]
==== Application Schema implementation classes
The implementation classes for the template application schema are shown in <<fig-implementation-of-classes>>. The attributes are shown for the coverage related classes together with the attribute classes.

In order to simplify the implementation, a number of defaults are assumed for S-102. These defaults simplify implementation and help simplify interaction with the Navigation Surface implementation from the Open Navigation Surface Working Group and other bathymetric gridded types. In the following sub clauses, the default values are emphasized so that they do not need to be encoded when generating an encoding of the implementation classes. However, if specified they must assume the stated values unless other options are stated.

===== Implementation classes description

[level=6]
===== BathymetryCoverage

[level=7]
===== BathymetryCoverage semantics

The class *BathymetryCoverage* has the attributes _minimumDepth_, _maximumDepth_, _minimumUncertainty_, and _maximumUncertainty_ which bound the depth attribute and the uncertainty attribute from the *S102_BathymetryValues* record. *BathymetryCoverage* additionally contains the inherited attributes _origin_, _offsetVectors_, _dimension_, _axisName_, _extent_, _sequenceRule_, and _startSequence_ from *S100_Grid* and *CV_Grid*.

The origin is a position in a specified coordinate reference system, and a set of offset vectors specify the direction and distance between the grid lines. It also contains the additional geometric characteristics of a rectified grid.

[level=7]
===== minimumDepth

The attribute _minimumDepth_ has the value type _Real_ and describes the lower bound of the depth estimate for all the _depth_ values in *S102_BathymetryValues* record. This attribute is required. There is no default.

[level=7]
===== maximumDepth

The attribute _maximumDepth_ has the value type _Real_ and describes the upper bound of the depth estimate for all the _depth_ values in *S102_BathymetryValues* record. This attribute is required. There is no default.

[level=7]
===== minimumUncertainty

The attribute _minimumUncertainty_ has the value type _Real_ and describes the lower bound of the uncertainty of the depth estimate for all the _depth_ values in *S102_BathymetryValues* record. If all uncertainty values are populated with the fill value (i.e., if no actual uncertainties exist in the data), this attribute shall be populated with the fill value. This attribute is required. There is no default.

[level=7]
===== maximumUncertainty

The attribute _maximumUncertainty_ has the value type _Real_ and describes the upper bound of the uncertainty of the depth estimate for all the _depth_ values in *S102_BathymetryValues* record.

=== Feature Catalogue

==== Introduction
The S-102 Feature Catalogue describes the feature types, attributes and attribute values which may be used in the product.

[[tsf]]The S-102 Feature Catalogue is available in an XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML Feature Catalogue Schema and can be downloaded from the IHO Geospatial Information Registry.[[ihoweb]]

==== Feature types
S-102 is a coverage feature product. *BathymetryCoverage* implements *S102_DepthCoverage* and includes *S102_BathymetryValues*.

===== Geographic
Geographic (geo) feature types form the principle content of the dataset and are fully defined by their associated attributes. In S-102, *BathymetryCoverage* has been registered as a geographic feature type.

===== Meta
There are no meta features in the S-102 feature catalogue.

==== Feature relationship
S-102 does not use any feature relationships.

==== Attributes

===== Simple attributes

In S-102, _depth_ and _uncertainty_ have been registered as simple attributes, type `<real>`. Simple attributes are defined in <<iho-s100,part=5,clause=5-4.2.3.3>>. 

===== Complex attributes
In S-102 there are currently no complex attributes defined.

=== Dataset types

==== Introduction
Bathymetric Surface datasets are represented as regular grids. The general structure for a regular grid is defined in <<iho-s100,part=8>>.

The geo-referencing for an S-102 Bathymetric Surface product shall be grid point based, referenced from the southwestern-most grid point. Each sample in a grid represents the value in the grid cell. The reference position included in the metadata shall be given in the coordinates used for the grid and shall contain sufficient digits of precision to locate the grid with accuracy no worse than a decimetre on the surface of the ellipsoid of rotation of the chosen horizontal datum.

==== Regular grid

===== S-102 coverages
The *BathymetryCoverage* contains depth and, optionally, uncertainty. The general structure of each is defined in <<iho-s100,part=8>> as a georectified grid.

The grid properties of origin and spacing are defined by attributes in the *BathymetryCoverage.01* Feature Container Group. The grid is a two-dimensional matrix organized in row major order and starting from the southwestern-most grid cell. Thus, the first sample of the grid is the grid point at the southwest corner of the grid with location specified by the georeferencing parameters, the second is one grid resolution unit to the east of that position and at the same northing or latitude, and the third is two grid resolution units to the east and at the same northing or latitude. For stem:[C] columns in the grid, the stem:[(C+1)]^th^ sample in the grid is located one grid resolution unit to the north but on the same easting or longitude as the first sample in the grid.

[[fig-s102-grid-point-location]]
.S-102 Grid point location
image::../images/figure-s102-grid-point-location.png[A matrix with 5 rows and 6 columns of cells. The overall matrix is labeled _X rows x C columns_. The leftmost element of the second lowest row is highlighted and labeled _C + 1_. The origin is shown at the bottom left and extends rightward.]

The two values, depth and optional uncertainty, are stored in the same grid as members of a data compound. The units of the depth values are in metres. The vertical distance is from a given water level to the bottom. Drying heights (drying soundings) are indicated by a negative depth value.

The reference vertical datum for the surface is one of the mandatory Metadata items. The unknown state for depth is defined to be 1,000,000.0 (1.0e6).

//Tables 14 and 15 are the QualityOfSurvey table and the new table describing vertical uncertainty type (formerly Table 19). The old clause 12.2 describing S-102-specific discovery metadata in the exchange catalogue has been deleted. This is a snapshot of the state of discussion on GitHub Issue #30 as of 23 March (RM comments in Word doc submitted circa 27Feb2023)


The uncertainty values are expressed as positive quantities at each grid cell. As detailed in <<tab-elements-of-featureAttributeTable-compound-datatype>> and <<tab-codes-defining-how-bathy-depth-uncertainty-determined>> the uncertainty grid supports multiple definitions of vertical uncertainty. This allows grids to span the expected range of data products from raw, full resolution grid to final compiled product. For example, a grid at the stage of final survey data processing should contain uncertainty information germane to the survey data itself and intended to be used for information compilation. A recipient of an S-102 file can refer to the uncertainty definition in the Metadata to gain an understanding of how the uncertainty was computed.

The undetermined state for uncertainty is defined to be 1,000,000.0 (1.0e6).

===== Extensions
In S-102 there are currently no extensions defined.

=== Multiple datasets
In order to facilitate the efficient processing of S-102 data, the geographic coverage of a given *maximum display Scale* may be split into multiple datasets.

=== Dataset rules
Each S-102 dataset must only have a single extent as it is a coverage feature. 

There should be no overlapping data of the same maximum display scale, except at the agreed adjoining limits. Where it is difficult to achieve a perfect join, a buffer to be agreed upon by the producing agencies may be used. 

=== Geometry
S-102 regular gridded coverages are an implementation of S-100 Grid Coverage (Part 8 - Imagery and Gridded Data).
