== Data Product Format (Encoding)

=== Introduction
The S-102 data set must be encoded using the Hierarchical Data Format standard, Version 5 (HDF5).

*Format Name*:: HDF5

*Version*:: 1.8

*Character Set*:: UTF-8

*Specification*:: https://www.hdfgroup.org/

The key idea behind the S-102 product structure is that each coverage is a feature. Each of these features is co-located with the others. Therefore, they share the same spatial metadata and each is required to correctly interpret the others.

For the use of HDF5, the following key concepts (<<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=5.1>>) are important:

_File_:: a contiguous string of bytes in a computer store (memory, disk, etc.), and the bytes represent zero or more objects of the model;

_Group_:: a collection of objects (including groups);

_Dataset_:: a multidimensional array of data elements with attributes and other metadata;

_Dataspace_:: a description of the dimensions of a multidimensional array;

_Datatype_:: a description of a specific class of data element including its storage layout as a pattern of bits; (Enumerations are encoded with unsigned 8-bit or unsigned 16-bit indices, depending on the number of transported values.)

_Attribute_:: a named data value associated with a group, dataset, or named datatype and stored as a scalar;

_Property List_:: a collection of parameters (some permanent and some transient).

In addition, datasets may be a compound (a single record consisting of an array of simple value types) and have multiple dimensions.

[[subsec-product-structure]]
=== Product structure
The structure of the data product follows the form given in <<iho-s100,part=10c>> -- HDF5 Data Model and File Format. The general structure, which was designed for several S-100 products is given in <<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>>.

[[fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure]]
.Outline of the generic data file structure
image::../images/figure-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure.png[UML diagram depicting the generic data file structure as described between this figure and the table Overview of S-102 Data Product]

<<fig-outline-of-the-generic-data-file-structure>> shows the four levels defined within the HDF encoding as defined in <<iho-s100,part=10c>>. Below is a further definition of these levels.

*Level 1*:: At the top level lies the Root Group, and it contains the Root Metadata and two subsidiary groups. The Root Metadata applies to all S-100 type products.

*Level 2*:: The next Level contains the Feature Information Group and the Feature Container Group. The Feature Information Group contains the feature *BathymetryCoverage* and the feature attribute codes. The Feature Container Group contains the Feature Metadata and one or more Feature Instance Groups.

*Level 3*:: This level contains a Feature Instance group. A feature instance is a bathymetric gridded data set for a single region.

*Level 4*:: This level contains the actual data for each feature. In S-102 the BathymetryCoverage uses the ValuesGroup to define the content. The other groups at this level are not used.

In <<tab-overview-of-s102-data-product>> below, levels refer to HDF5 structuring (see <<iho-s100,part=10c,figure=9>>). Naming in each box below the header line is as follows: Generic name; S-100 or S-102 name, or nothing if none; and (_HDF5 type_) group, attribute or attribute list, or dataset. <<fig-hierarchy-of-s102-data-product>> depicts the same structure using a graphical representation.

//I have struggled mightily with writing alt text for fig-hierarchy-of-s102-data-product. What is included is my best draft. Also considered was the following: "Three blocks reside at Level 1: Group_F, BathymetryCoverage, and QualityOfSurvey. Group_F spawns 3 blocks in Level 2 (each of which spawn no further blocks): BathymetryCoverage, QualityOfSurvey, and featureCode. BathymetryCoverage in Level 1 spawns 2 blocks in Level 2: BathymetryCoverage.01 and axisNames (which spawns no further blocks). QualityOfSurvey in Level 1 spawns 2 blocks in Level 2: QualityOfSurvey.01 and featureAttributeTable (which spawns no further blocks). BathymetryCoverage.01 spawns Group_001 in Level 3, which spawns values in Level 4. QualityOfSurvey.01 spawns Group_001 in Level 3, which spawns values in Level 4." (lhh comment 7 July 2023)

The following sections explain entries in <<tab-overview-of-s102-data-product>> in greater detail.

==== Root Group

The root group is required by HDF5. The S-100 HDF5 format (<<iho-s100,part=10c>>) attaches metadata attributes applicable to the whole dataset to this group. S-102 uses all the S-100 attributes except _geographicIdentifier_ and _metaFeatures_. The attributes used in S-102 are listed in <<tab-root-group-attributes>>, with specific requirements, if any, added in the Remarks column.

[[note1]]
[NOTE]
====
The remark in S-100 Edition 5.0.0 is outdated. The _productIdentifier_ ("S-102") and _version_ fields (N.N.N) of S100_ProductSpecification must be used instead of _name_ and _number_.
====

[[note2]]
[NOTE]
====
The value horizontalCRS specifies the horizontal Coordinate Reference System. At the time of writing, S-100 does not yet provide a mechanism for this value's definition within HDF5 encoding (such as an enumeration of horizontal CRSs). Consequently, this configuration causes a deviation from S-100. The horizontal datum is implicitly defined by this CRS because each horizontal CRS consists of a coordinate system and a datum. S-102 does not use "user defined" CRS as mentioned in <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=6>>.
====

//Tentative, TBD. If so-called “user defined crs” is also allowed in order to encode projection parameters in the HDF5 dataset, #s 5-19 from S-100 Table 10c-6 will have to be added to the table. (RM comment from 4Jan2023)
//Parameters 5-19 from S-100 Table 10c-6 have been provisionally added. Delete the sentence about S-102 not using “user-defined” CRS if S-102 will use “user-defined” CRS. (RM comment from 20Jan2023


[[note3]]
[NOTE]
====
The baseCRS is the geodetic CRS on which the projected CRS is based. In particular, the datum of the base CRS is also used for the derived CRS (see <<iho-s100,part=6,table=6>>).
====


[[note12]]
[NOTE]
====
This is the default vertical datum (verticalDatum), unless a distinct vertical datum(verticalDatum) is specified for the corresponding feature instance group (BathymetryCoverage.nn).
====

==== Feature Codes (Group_F)
No attributes.

This group specifies the S-100 features to which the data applies, and consists of three components:

*featureCode* -- a 1-dimensional dataset with the featureCode(s) of the S-100 feature(s) contained in the data product. For S-102, the dataset has only two elements -- the string "*BathymetryCoverage*" and "*QualityOfBathymetryCoverage*" (without quotes). The entries in this dataset give the names of the other two components of Group_F.

*BathymetryCoverage* -- A 1-dimensional dataset that contains the standard definition of the bathymetry coverage feature class in terms of its attributes and their types, units of measure, etc. The datatype of its elements is the compound type described in <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=8>>.

*QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* -- A 1-dimensional dataset of the same datatype as the *BathymetryCoverage* dataset described above. This *QualityOfBathymetryCoverage* dataset contains the definition of the reference to metadata records. The reference is a single integer which identifies a metadata record in _featureAttributeTable_ (described in <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.6.2>> and <<root-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage>>.

//QualityOfBathymetricData is defined in the GI Registry as “An area within which a uniform assessment of the quality of the bathymetric data exists.” That does not describe this dataset, which provides information at the level of individual cells. Recommend new type QualityOfSurveyCoverage or QualityOfBathymetryCoverage, defined as “A set of references to value records that provide localised information about depths, uncertainties, and survey metadata.” It can be proposed to the GI Registry after the S-102 team approves it. (RM comment 23Jan2023)

==== BathymetryCoverage and QualityOfBathymetryCoverage Tables (in Group_F)

BathymetryCoverage and QualityOfBathymetryCoverage are arrays of compound type elements, whose components are the 8 components specified in <<tab-sample-contents-of-the-BathymetryCoverage-and-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage-arrays>>.

According to <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.5>>, "All the numeric values in the feature description dataset are string representations of numeric values; for example, "-9999.0" not the float value -9999.0."

While the sample contents are shown in the two attributes columns, these are actually rows in the BathymetryCoverage table. They are also each a single HDF5 compound type and represent a single HDF5 element in the table.

All cells shall be HDF5 variable length strings. The minimum and maximum values are stored in lower and upper columns. Variable length strings allow future proofing the format in the event editing is allowed or correcting these values is required.

|===

The gridOriginLongitude, gridOriginLatitude, gridSpacingLongitudinal, and gridSpacingLatitudinal attributes should be in the same geographic units as the bounding box. Note that this practice deviates from S-100 where it indicates that this value should be in Arc Degrees.

numPointsLongitude and numPointsLatitude must contain the number of cells in the x and y dimensions of the values table.

The S-102 uses the "Attribute Overwriting" option of the <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.7.1>>. This allows the feature instance group to overwrite the attributes of a higher group, in this case the 'verticalDatum'. The default vertical datum is specified in the root group (see table <<tab-root-group-attributes>>). A new separate feature instance group must be created for all areas with a vertical datum that differs from the default vertical datum. Only feature instance groups with a value that differs from the default vertical datum use the additional attribute "verticalDatum" on the feature instance group.

The use of multiple vertical datums within an S-102 product requires the use of "domainExtent.polygon". In addition, according to S-100, either the BoundingBox at the Feature Instance Group or the "domainExtent.polygon" must be specified. When using multiple vertical datums, the use of the "domainExtent.polygon" is mandatory, which means that the BoundingBox is not specified in this case. The grid cells that do not belong to the area of the respective vertical datum are to be assigned the no-data values. The domainExtent.polgons of different Feature Instance groups must not overlap. At positions where the polygons of different Feature Instance groups touch, the edges must be identical. The domainExtent.polgon does not have to follow the borders of the grid cells, but is an independent vector geometry based on the SoundingDatum surface from S-101. The domainExtent.polgon only supports a simple polygon geometry in accordance with <<iho-s100,part=10c,table=11>>. The mapping of multi-polygons and inner rings is not possible.

==== The values group -- Group_001
This group contains the following attributes. These attributes are not defined by <<iho-s100,part=10c>>. They are an extension of this Product Specification.

The group contains an HDF5 dataset named values containing the bathymetric gridded data.

[[subsec-BathymetryCoverage-feature-instance-group-values-dataset]]
==== BathymetryCoverage feature instance group -- values dataset

This dataset contains the compound data arrays containing bathymetric gridded data. These components are explained below.

For bathymetric gridded data, the dataset includes a two-dimensional array containing always the depth and under certain conditions uncertainty data. These dimensions are defined by _numPointsLongitudinal_ and _numPointsLatitudinal_. By knowing the grid origin and the grid spacing, the position of every grid point and grid cell can be simply computed. 

If the uncertainty for each grid cell is equal, it is not necessary to store it at each cell in the grid. The uniqueness of the uncertainty results from the equality of the attributes "minimumUncertainty" and "maximumUncertainty" of Group_001 of the BathymetryCoverage (see <<tab-attributes-of-values-group>> No. 3 & 4). If the uncertainty values at the grid cells are omitted, it must be ensured that the entry of the uncertainty of the BathymetryCoverage in the Group_F is also omitted (see <<tab-sample-contents-of-the-BathymetryCoverage-and-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage-arrays>>). This type of storage technique can reduce the amount of memory required for the uncertainty without loss of information. The uncertainty of each grid cell can be immediately obtained from the "minimumUncertainty" or "maximumUncertainty" attributes of Group_001 of the BathymetryCoverage.

If the uncertainty is not the same for each grid cell, it must be stored at each cell in the grid. For unknown or unused uncertainty data, it must be filled with the fillValue specified in the Group_F feature information dataset.

The grid cell values are stored in two-dimensional arrays with a prescribed number of columns (numCOL) and rows (numROW). This grid is defined as a regular grid (dataCodingFormat = 2); therefore, the depth and uncertainty values will be for each cell in the grid. The data type of the array values is a compound with one or two members.

[[root-QualityOfBathymetryCoverage]]
==== Root QualityOfBathymetryCoverage

The QualityOfBathymetryCoverage container group has the same metadata attributes as BathymetryCoverage container group (see <<tab-attributes-of-bathymetrycoverage-feature-container-group>>). The values of the attributes must also be the same as the BathymetryCoverage container group. An exception is the attribute 'dataCodingFormat', which must be '9'. The use of multiple BathymetryCoverage Feature Instance groups (different Vertical Datums) does not affect the multiplicity of the QualityOfBathymetryCoverage, which remains 0 to 1. This means that the different BathymetryCoverage Feature Instance groups share a common QualityOfBathymetryCoverage.

The QualityOfBathymetryCoverage container group contains an additional 1-dimensional array named featureAttributeTable (<<iho-s100,part=10c,table=9>>; <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=9.6.2>>). This dataset is mandatory within the QualityOfBathymetryCoverage group. Each element of this array is a metadata record of HDF5 compound type. The fields are described in <<tab-elements-of-featureAttributeTable-compound-datatype>> below.

//(1) Are these fields mandatory? (2) Can producers add other fields like surveyType and line spacing? (RM comment 4Jan2023)
//All optional except id. Producers should not add other fields. (RM comment 23Jan2023)

[[subsec-note4]]
[NOTE]
====
A feature in this context is any object, whether manmade or not, projecting above the sea floor, which may be a danger for surface navigation <<iho-s44>>. Least depth of detected features measured does not describe the least depth of features that were actually detected during a hydrographic survey, but the ability of the survey to detect the least depth of features with a maximum uncertainty as defined in <<iho-s44>>.

[[subsec-note5]]
[NOTE]
====
A feature in this context is any object, whether manmade or not, projecting above the sea floor, which may be a danger for surface navigation <<iho-s44>>. Significant features detected does not describe if significant features were actually detected during a hydrographic survey, but whether the survey had the capacity to detect significant features.
====

[[subsec-note6]]
[NOTE]
====
The role of the attribute, featureSizeVar is described in <<qualityAndSourceMetadata>>. The expectation is that featureSizeVar will be set to zero if the feature size does not scale with depth. As with featureSize, featureSizeVar should be ignored if significantFeatures is False.
====

[[subsec-note7]]
[NOTE]
====
When both featureSize and featureSizeVar are present, the greater of the two should be considered valid.
====

[[subsec-note8]]
[NOTE]
====
Full seafloor coverage achieved applies to both the spatial completeness of feature detection and to the spatial completeness of the measurement of the regular seafloor. The former is further specified by the complex attribute features detected; the latter by the attributes depth range maximum value and depth range minimum value.
====

[[subsec-note9]]
[NOTE]
====
The attribute bathyCoverage is especially useful in side-scan surveys which are characterized by gaps in bathymetric observations with full coverage side-scan imagery (interpolated gapes between bathymetry coverage in this situation would show fullCoverage = True and bathyCoverage = False). If fullCoverage = False, bathyCoverage must also equal False, such as gaps between single beam echosounder data without correlating side-scan sonar coverage.
