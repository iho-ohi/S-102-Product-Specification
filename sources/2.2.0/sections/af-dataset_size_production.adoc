== S-102 Dataset Size and Production

=== Header Record
An S-102 file will contain two header sections. The first section contains, at minimum, the mandatory metadata elements as defined in S-100 Part 4. The second section contains, at minimum, the mandatory metadata elements as defined in <<sec-metadata>> of the S-102 Product Specification. The producers may add optionally defined metadata to these sections, as their processes/standards require.

Given that the contents of these metadata attributes will vary between producers, it is impossible to define a definitive size for the file header. The estimated maximum size for the full header of an S-102 file is 3 MB. This is an estimate based on the expected encoding of mandatory metadata in both S-100/S-102, usage of the optional metadata elements and expected verbosity of those elements.


=== Data Records/Nodes
The data contained within an S-102 file consists of a single data type. This data is the *BathymetryCoverage* and is defined as a two-dimensional array of nodes containing bathymetric data. Each of the nodes within this array contains two data values (depth and uncertainty). Both values are stored as a 4-byte floating point. The total size of each node will therefore be 8 bytes.

=== File Estimates
<<tab-calculated-file-size-for-10mb-and-256mb-uncompressed-dataset>> estimates the possible number of records for a given S-102 file. This estimation is based on file size constraints and the estimates described above. Rounded to the nearest hundred, this estimate allows us to state that a file not exceeding 600x600 will remain below the 10 MB. <<fig-informative-grid-extents-for-a-10mb-uncompressed-dataset>> depicts the maximum grid size for 10MB.
