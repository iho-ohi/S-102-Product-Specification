== Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

=== Introduction
The geo-referencing for an S-102 Bathymetric Surface product shall be node-based, referenced from the southwestern-most node in a grid. Each sample in a grid represents the value in the grid at a point location at the coordinate specified, rather than an estimate over any area with respect to the coordinate. The reference position included in the metadata shall be given in the coordinates used for the grid and shall contain sufficient digits of precision to locate the grid with accuracy no worse than a decimetre on the surface of the ellipsoid of rotation of the chosen horizontal datum.

The Coordinate Reference System information contained in <<tab-s102-coordinate-reference-systems-epsg-codes>> is defined in the manner specified in S-100 Part 6. Note the vertical datum is defined through a second association role to a vertical reference system.

=== Spatial Reference System
All coverages in the Bathymetric Surface Product Specification are geo-rectified, simple uniform regular grids as defined in <<iho-s100>> Part 8.

The grid data in a S-102 Bathymetric Surface coverage (either depth or uncertainty, and any other surfaces that may be added) shall be organized as a uniform regular grid in row-major order from west to east, and south to north. Thus, the first sample of the grid is the node at the southwest corner of the grid with location as specified by the geo-referencing parameters, the second is one grid resolution unit to the east of that position and at the same northing or latitude, and the third is two grid resolution units to the east and at the same northing or latitude. For C columns in the grid, the stem:[(C+1)^{th}] sample in the grid is located one grid resolution unit to the north, but on the same easting, or longitude, as the first sample in the grid.

=== Vertical Coordinate Reference System
All valid S-102 datasets shall be represented with a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. This system shall have the x-axis oriented towards positive eastings (for projected grids), or east (for geographic grids), and y-axis oriented towards positive northings (for projected grids), or north (for geographic grids). These definitions imply that the z-axis for the sounding data is positive away from the center of mass of the earth (that is, is positive up), rather than the usual hydrographic convention of positive down (that is, deeper depths are larger numbers and negative depths are above datum). User-level code is free to make this reflection if required but must write the data using the positive-up convention. The uncertainty component shall have the same coordinate system as the depth component, with the exception that the z-axis is unipolar, and therefore the concept of direction of positive increase is irrelevant.


=== Temporal Reference System
The temporal reference system is the Gregorian calendar for date and UTC for time. Time is measured by reference to Calendar dates and Clock time in accordance with <<iso-8601>>, Temporal Schema, clause 5.4.4. A date-time variable will have the following 16-character format: _yyyymmddThhmmssZ_.
