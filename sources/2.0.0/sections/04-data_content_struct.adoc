== Data Content and structure

=== Introduction
The Bathymetric Surface Product incorporates aspects of the Navigation Surface concept where in addition to estimation of depth, an optional estimate of the uncertainty associated with the depth can be computed and preserved. To make the system suitable to support safety of navigation applications, there is a means to over-ride any automatically constructed depth estimates with 'Hydrographer Privilege, (essentially, a means to specify directly the depth determined by a human observer as being the most significant in the area - irrespective of any statistical evidence to the contrary). The original grid values that are replaced by the hydrographer are preserved in the tracking list so that they can be restored if required.

<<fig-overview-structure-s102>> below shows a high-level overview of the structure of S-102. It shows that the Bathymetric Surface Product consists of a set of data comprising the HDF5 datasets plus a Digital Certification Block. The Digital Certification Block is mandatory when the data product is produced for navigational purposes so that the user can trace whether the data has been certified. The HDF5 file consists of metadata (spatial, feature and discovery), collocated coverages consisting of depth and uncertainty values, and a tracking list of overridden nodes. S-102 uses the S-100 Data Protection Scheme to ensure certification and authentication.

Thus, the Bathymetric Surface Product is a hybrid of coverage(s), as defined in <<iho-s100>> Part 8, and Information Types as defined in <<iho-s100>> Part 4, together with a point set tracking list. This is described in <<subsec-application-schema>>.

[[subsec-application-schema]]
=== Application Schema
The Application Schema for S-102 is a template Application Schema. That is, it does not resolve all attributes and allows some choice. This means that an implementer, such as a national hydrographic office, can produce another application schema as a profile of this application schema that makes additional choices. For example, the choice of whether to use a tiling scheme and which tiling scheme to use is left open. An implementer, such as a national hydrographic office, can select the tiling scheme, extent, resolution and other parameters most appropriate for their situation. Since the general structure is defined by the template Application Schema, common software that supports the S-102 template schema is able to support national and other more specific profiles.

The Application Schema Data Set Structure is shown in <<fig-data-set-structure-s102>> and <<fig-coverage-structure-of-s102>>. They show a number of classes specialized for use in S-102 and two sets of implementation classes. An actual data set of S-102 bathymetry data only contains the implementation classes. All of the required attributes from the other classes in the application schema are satisfied by statements within the Product Specification. This approach to producing the Application Schema results in a very simple structure for implementation.

[[fig-data-set-structure-s102]]
.Data Set Structure of S-102
image::figure-data-set-structure-s102.png[]


The model in <<fig-data-set-structure-s102>> states that:

* An S-102 data set (*S102_DataSet*), which is inherited from *S100_DataSet*, references an S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection (*S102_IGCollection*). The relationship allows a 1 to many (*1..**) multiplicity which means that there may be multiple instances of S-102 data collections. Each collection may or may not correspond to a tiling scheme, and each S102 Dataset would correspond to a single tile. The S-102 discovery metadata class (*S102_DiscoveryMetadata*) describes the metadata entities required for the identification of the entire data set. The required discovery metadata is implemented through the *S102_DSMetadataBlock* class.

* An instance of an S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection (*S102_IGCollection*) which is a subtype of *S100_IGCollection*, is described by a set of S-102 Collection Metadata (*S102_CollectionMetadata*). This relationship is 1 to 1 meaning that there is one set of collection metadata for each instance of *S102_IGCollection*. There is a large choice of metadata that may be used in a S-100 compliant data product. Only a small amount of this metadata is mandated by <<iso19115>> for discovery. The choice of metadata is discussed in clause 9.2.5. Much of the metadata can be resolved as part of the product specification. Only that metadata that varies IG_collection item to item needs be included in the S102_MetadataBlock implementation class.

* An S-102 Image and Gridded Data Collection also optionally makes reference to a tiling scheme.

This is discussed further in <<subsec-tiling-scheme-partitioning>>.


[[fig-coverage-structure-of-s102]]
.Coverage Structure of S-102
image::figure-coverage-structure-of-s102.png[]


The model in <<fig-coverage-structure-of-s102>> depicts two coverage types in this application schema:

* The first coverage type is a discrete Regular Grid Coverage called *S102_DepthCoverage* which inherits from (*S100_GridCoverage*). Many of the parameters of the coverage are described in the product specification. The implementation classes are co-registered, co-geospatially located datasets.

* The second coverage type is a discrete point set coverage called *S102_CorrectionCoverage*. The *S102_CorrectionCoverage* consists of a set of discrete points that correspond to locations which had corrective overrides applied. (that is, a hydrographer may explicitly specify depth values at specific points to deliberately ensure safety of navigation.) The conflation function simply replaces specific values from the S102_BathymetryValues grid values matrix with the corresponding overriding values.


==== Application Schema Implementation Classes
The implementation classes for the template application schema are shown in <<fig-implementation-of-classes>>. The attributes are shown for the coverage related classes together with the attribute classes.

In order to simplify the implementation a number of defaults are assumed for S-102. These defaults simplify implementation and help simplify interaction with the Navigation Surface implementation from the Open Navigation Surface Working Group and other bathymetric gridded types. In the following sub clauses, the default values are emphasized so that they do not need to be encoded when generating an encoding of the implementation classes. However, if specified they must assume the stated values unless other options are stated.

[level=7]
===== S102_BathymetryValues semantics

The class *S102_BathymetryValues* is related to *BathymetryCoverage* by a composition relationship in which an ordered sequence of _depth_ values provide data values for each grid cell. The class *S102_BathymetryValues* inherits from S100_Grid.

[level=7]
===== values

The attribute _values_ has the value type *_S102_BathymetryValueRecord_* which is a sequence of value items that shall assign values to the grid points. There are two attributes in the bathymetry value record, depth and _uncertainty_ in the *S102_BathymetryValues* class. The definition for the _depth_ is defined by the _depthCorrectionType_ attribute in the *S102_DataIdentification* class. The definition of the type of data in the values record is defined by the _verticalUncertaintyType_ attribute in the *S102_DataIdentification* class.


[level=6]

[level=7]
===== dimension

The attribute _dimension_ is a derived attribute that describes the length of coordinate.

[level=6]
===== CV_GridEnvelope

[level=7]
===== CV_GridEnvelope semantics

The class *CV_GridEnvelope* provides the grid coordinate values for the diametrically opposed corners of an envelope that bounds a grid. It has two attributes.

[level=7]
===== low

The attribute _low_ shall be the minimal coordinate values for all grid points within the envelope. For this specification this represents the Southwestern coordinate.

[level=7]

The ordering of these coordinate values shall be the same as that of the elements of _axisNames_. The value of a single coordinate shall be the number of offsets from the origin of the grid in the direction of a specific axis.


[level=6]
===== CV_SequenceRule

[level=7]
===== CV_SequenceRule semantics

The class *CV_SequenceRule* contains information for mapping grid coordinates to a position within the sequence of records of feature attribute values. It has two attributes.

[level=7]
===== type

The attribute _type_ shall identify the type of sequencing method that shall be used. A code list of scan types is provided in S-100 Part 8. Only the value -- linear‖ shall be used in S-102, which describes scanning row by row by column.

[level=7]
===== scanDirection

The attribute _scanDirection_ has the value class _Sequence<CharacterString>_ a list of axis names that indicates the order in which grid points shall be mapped to position within the sequence of records of feature attribute values. The scan direction for all layers in S-102 is "Longitude" and "Latitude" or west to east, then south to north.

[level=6]
===== TrackingListCoverage

[level=7]
===== TrackingListCoverage semantics

The class *TrackingListCoverage* has the attributes _domainExtent_, _rangeType_, _CommonPointRule_ and _metadata_ inherited from *S100_PointCoverage*. The *TrackingListCoverage* is a discrete point coverage which is used to track overridden nodes in the *BathymetryCoverage* by allowing a hydrographer to apply a bias for safety of navigation. The attribute _metadata_ provides one method of linking the metadata to the coverage inherited from S-100, however it is not required in S-102 because there is no need for specific metadata at the feature (class) level. The attribute _commonPointRule_ is also not required because the value has been established for the whole of the S-102 data product to be "average". The attribute _rangeType_ takes on the value class _RecordType_. This is modelled by the composition of multiple instances of *S102_TrackingListValues*. Therefore, only the attribute _domainExtent_ is required, and it has a default value.

[level=7]
===== domainExtent

The attribute _domainExtent_ has the value class _EX_GeographicExtent_ which describes the spatial boundaries of the tracking list elements within the bounds established by CV_GridEnvelope for the *BathymetryCoverage*. The _default is the bounds established by the attribute CV_GridEnvelope_.

[level=6]
===== S102_TrackingListValues

[level=7]
===== S102_TrackingListValues semantics

The class *S102_TrackingListValues* has the attributes _trackCode_ and _listSeries_, and the attributes _geometry_, and _value_ inherited from *S100_VertexPoint* and *CV_GeometryValuePair*. The tracking list is a discrete coverage used to furnish the set of values that were overridden in the *S102_BathymetryValues* class. To assure alignment of tracking list values with the grid cells in the bathymetry coverage grid, the reference system for the tracking list is the bathymetry coverage regular grid.

The _trackCode_ value and the _listSeries_ value provide context for the override a value from the bathymetry coverage. The _trackCode_ value is a text string that describes the reason for the override.

[level=7]
===== trackCode

The optional attribute _trackCode_ has the value type _CharacterString_ which may contain a text string describing the reason for the override of the corresponding depth and uncertainty values in the bathymetry coverage. This is a user definable field with values defined in the lineage metadata.

[level=7]
===== listSeries

The attribute _listSeries_ has the value type _Integer_ which contains an index number into a list of metadata elements describing the reason for the override of the corresponding _depth_ and _uncertainty_ values in the bathymetry coverage.

[level=7]
===== geometry

The attribute _geometry_ has the value class *GM_Point* which is a position that shall locate the tracking list value. When the *TrackingListCoverage* discrete coverage and the *BathymetryCoverage* are conflated the values that are overridden in the sequence of the attribute *S102_BathymetryValues* are located by position. The value class is *GM_Point* which is the x, y grid post coordinate of the coverage.

[level=7]
===== value

The attribute _value_ has the value class _Record_ which is a sequence of value items that shall assign values to the discrete grid point. There are two values in each record in the *S102_TrackingListValues* class. These are the _depth_ and the _uncertainty_ values that were overridden in corresponding grid coverages.


[level=6]
===== GM_Point

[level=7]
===== GM_Point semantics

The class *GM_Point* is taken from <<iso19107>> and is the basic data type for a geometric object consisting of one and only one point. It has one attribute.

[level=7]
===== position

The attribute _position_ is derived from *DirectPosition* for the geometry primitive GM_Point. To assure alignment of tracking list values with the grid points in the bathymetry coverage grid, the reference system for the tracking list is the bathymetry coverage regular grid. This means that the _position_ attribute corresponds to a grid point. For a uniform regular grid this is the row and column of the grid point position.

[level=6]
===== EX_GeographicExtent

[level=7]
===== EX_GeographicExtent semantics

The class *EX_GeographicExtent* is a metadata class from <<iso19115>>. It is a component of the metaclass *EX_Extent*. The use of *EX_GeographicExtent* is optional. When used it describes the spatial boundaries of the Tracking List elements within the bounds established by *CV_GridEnvelope* for the BathymetryCoverage. That is, the tracking list may carry information corresponding only to a portion of the spatial extent covered by the *BathymetryCoverage*. There is one attribute and one subtype.

[level=7]
===== extentTypeCode

The attribute _extentTypeCode_ is a Boolean value. It is used to indicate whether the bounding polygon/box encompasses an area covered by the data or an area where data is not present. In S-102 it is set to 1.

[level=6]
===== EX_GeographicBoundingBox

[level=7]
===== EX_GeographicBoundingBox semantics

The class *EX_GeographicBoundingBox* is a metadata class from <<iso19115>>. It is a subtype of the abstract class EX_GeographicExtent. It defines a bounding box used to indicate the spatial boundaries of the tracking list elements within the bounds established by *CV_GridEnvelope* for the *BathymetryCoverage*. It has four attributes.

[level=7]
===== westBoundLongitude

The attribute _westBoundLongitude_ is a coordinate value providing the west bound longitude for the bound.

[level=7]
===== eastBoundLongitude

The attribute _eastBoundLongitude_ is a coordinate value providing the east bound longitude for the bound.

[level=7]
===== southBoundLatitude

The attribute _southBoundLatitude_ is a coordinate value providing the south bound longitude for the bound.

[level=7]
===== northBoundLatitude

The attribute _northBoundLatitude_ is a coordinate value providing the north bound longitude for the bound.

[[subsec-tiling-scheme-partitioning]]
==== Tiling Scheme (Partitioning)
Tiling is a technique to decompose an area of interest into smaller more manageable chunks of data or partition. Each tile for an S-102 Bathymetry surface product is a complete *BathymetryCoverage* with depth and uncertainty values and optional tracking list together with metadata that is edge matched to adjacent tiles.

A Tiling scheme is a second higher level discrete grid coverage where the tiles are the value items of the discrete coverage. As such a tiling scheme requires a complete description as a coverage.

The tiling scheme does not have to be described with the data set, but it is necessary that the data set be able to index into the tiling scheme, and that the tiling scheme be well documented and able to be referenced.

<<fig-s102-tiling-scheme>> shows the *S102_TilingScheme* structure. This structure is inherited from S-100. It is left general in order to accommodate different tiling schemes to be used by different data producers or national hydrographic offices.

The current S-102 assumes the Tiling Scheme is defined externally. However, a tile identifier is contained in the XML metadata as defined in *S102_Tile*. Future enhancements to this specification will include the capability of specifying a tiling scheme internally as defined by *S102_TIlingScheme* and a sequence of *S102_Tiles* internally plus include the collection of datasets in a single package.

=== Feature Catalogue

==== Introduction
The S-102 Feature Catalogue describes the feature types, information types, attributes, attribute values, associations and roles which may be used in the product.

The S-102 Feature Catalogue is available in an XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML Feature Catalogue Schema and can be downloaded from the IHO website.

Note, for Imagery and Gridded Data, coverage is a type of feature so a product specification may not contain a "`catalogue`" with the exception of the environmental parameter the dataset models. Therefore, much of this clause may be irrelevant.

==== Feature Types
S-102 is a coverage feature product. There are two coverages defined in this specification: *BathymetryCoverage* and *TrackingListCoverage*. *BathymetryCoverage* implements *S102_DepthCoverage* and includes *S102_BathymetryValues*. The second coverage, TrackingListCoverage implements *S102_CorrectionCoverage*, and includes *S102_TrackingListValues*. The *S102_CorrectionCoverage* is a discrete point set coverage.


===== Geographic
Geographic (geo) feature types form the principle content of the dataset and are fully defined by their associated attributes and information types. In S-102, *BathymetryCoverage* has been registered as a geographic feature type.

===== Meta
The only meta feature within an S-102 dataset is the tracking list. The tracking list is a simple list of nodes that have been modified to account for hydrographer over-rides of the basic surface definition (for example as originally computed by an algorithmic method). Each record within the list contains the original depth value (referenced to the associated node within the surface) and information about the override that occurred. The tracking list dataset and corresponding information contained in the metadata exist to provide an audit trail record of changes made to the data by manual intervention.

==== Feature Relationship
A feature relationship links instances of one feature type with instances of the same or a different feature type. There are three common types of feature relationship: Association, Aggregation and Composition.

S-102 uses only one type of feature relationship: Association.

===== Association
An association is used to describe a relationship between two feature types that defines relationships between their instances.

[example]
====
A *S102_IG_Collection* may contain a (0 or 1) *S102_TilingScheme*.

In S-102, _depth_ and _uncertainty_ have been registered as simple attributes, type <real>.


===== Complex Attributes
In S-102 there are currently no complex attributes defined.

=== Dataset Types

==== Introduction
Bathymetric Surface datasets are represented as a discrete array of points contained in a regular grid. The general structure for a regular grid is defined in <<iho-s100>> Part 8.

==== Regular Grid

===== S-102 Coverages
The major components of the Bathymetric Surface product are the *BathymetryCoverage* and the *TrackingListCoverage*. The *BathymetryCoverage* contains depth and, optionally, uncertainty. The general structure of each is defined in <<iho-s100>> Part 8 as a georectified grid. Spatial metadata parameters are defined in *S102_StructureMetadataBlock*. Furthermore, the two values are co-located within the *BathymetryCoverage*. Each layer contains a two-dimensional matrix organized in row major order, and starting from the south-western most data point, where each value is defined to be at an exactly specified geographic point (or grid node).

The units of the depth values are in metres, and the sign convention is for z to be positive for values above the vertical datum. The reference vertical datum for the surface is one of the mandatory Metadata items. This sign convention follows directly from the right-hand coordinate system definition to which the standard adheres.

The unknown state for depth is defined to be 1,000,000.0 (1.0e6).

The uncertainty values are expressed as positive quantities at a node. As detailed in <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> the uncertainty grid supports multiple definitions of vertical uncertainty. This allows grids to span the expected range of data products from raw, full resolution grid to final compiled product. For example, a grid at the stage of final survey data processing should contain uncertainty information germane to the survey data itself and intended to be used for information compilation. A recipient of an S-102 file can refer to the uncertainty definition in the Metadata to gain an understanding of how the uncertainty was computed.

The undetermined state for uncertainty is defined to be 1,000,000.0 (1.0e6).


===== Extensions
The Bathymetric Surface Product Specification is extensible. This includes both extensions to the content model and to the encodings supporting the content model. Extensions are optional coverages and not required for a file to be qualified nor do they invalidate a compliant product. Additional layers of information not related to the bathymetric scope of this product specification should be defined in separate S.100 and S.10x compliant layers.

=== Multiple Datasets
In order to facilitate the efficient processing of S-102 data, the geographic coverage of a given *maximum display Scale* may be split into multiple datasets.

The discovery or exchange metadata of a dataset must list all extents or the *Data Coverage* features contained within that dataset and their assigned scale attributions.

=== Dataset Rules
Each S-102 dataset must only have a single extent as it is a coverage feature.

There should be no overlapping data of the same *maximum display scale*, except at the agreed adjoining limits. Where it is difficult to achieve a perfect join, a buffer to be agreed upon by the producing agencies may be used.

In order to facilitate the efficient processing of S-102 data the geographic coverage of a given *maximum display scale* may be split into multiple datasets.

=== Geometry
S-102 regular gridded coverages are an implementation of S-100 Grid Coverage (Part 8 - Imagery and Gridded Data) and is composed of a series of discrete points. S-102 tracking list is a series of S100 Points (Part 8 - Point) in which the xy of each point is a reference to a location within the gridded coverage where an override occurred.
