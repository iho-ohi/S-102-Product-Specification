*Title*:: Bathymetric Surface

*Abstract*:: The Bathymetric Surface Product consists of a set of values organized to form a regular grid coverage, with associated metadata, for an area of the sea, river, lake or other body of water. Final grid coverage includes a depth value and associated uncertainty estimate for each location in the matrix. In addition, a discrete point set called a "tracking list" is included. The tracking list contains locations where a hydrographer or the data producer overrode a grid matrix value to deliberately bias the final surface for safety of navigation. That is, the data set can carry both the corrected depth information to support the safe navigation of marine vessels as well as the original measured depth value to support scientific purposes.

*Geographic Description*:: Areas specific to marine navigation.

*Spatial Resolution*:: The spatial resolution, or the spatial dimension on the earth covered by the size of a grid matrix cell (nominal ground sample distance), varies according to the model adopted by (the producer hydrographic office).

*Purpose*:: The primary purpose of the bathymetric surface product is to provide high resolution bathymetry in gridded form in support of safety of navigation. The secondary purpose is to provide high resolution bathymetry for other maritime applications.
