=== Feature Attributes

==== BathymetryCoverage

[%unnumbered]
[cols="a"]
|===

|*depth*: IHO Definition: DEPTH; The vertical distance from a given water level to the bottom [<<iho-s32>>]

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* For S-102 the sign convention is for z to be positive for values above the vertical datum

|*uncertainty*: IHO Definition: UNCERTAINTY; The interval (about a given value) that will contain the true value of the measurement at a specific confidence level [<<iho-s44>>]

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* Represents a +/- value defining the possible range of associated depth
* Expressed a positive number

==== TrackingListCoverage


[%unnumbered]
[cols="a"]
|===

|*X*: IHO Definition: GRID POINT; point located at the intersection of two or more curves in a grid [<<iso-19123>>]

|Unit: column

|Resolution: N/A

|Remarks:

* Bound by _numPointsLongitudinal_ (S100 Part 10c)

|*Y*: IHO Definition: GRID POINT; point located at the intersection of two or more curves in a grid [<<iso-19123>>]

|Unit: row

|Resolution: N/A

|Remarks:

* Bound by _numPointsLatitudinal_ (S100 Part 10c)

|*original value*: IHO Definition: DEPTH; The vertical distance from a given water level to the bottom [<<iho-s32>>]

|Unit: metres

|Resolution: 0.01

|Remarks:

* For S-102 the sign convention is for z to be positive for values above the vertical datum

|*track code*: IHO Definition: value indicating why a modification was made to the depth value

|Unit: ENUM

|Resolution: N/A

|*list series*: IHO Definition: value indicating the index location within the metadata defining the modification

|Unit: N/A

|Resolution: N/A
